[{"title": "Equilibrium", "body": "## Introduction\n\nThis is the Equilibrium campaign, a story about an international crime solving\nteam, the Supernatural Phenomena Investigators (SPI), set in a fantasy world of\neight nations hanging in the balance.\n\n## Logistics\n\n**Why?** To have fun, relax, solve mysteries and beat bad guys.\n\n**Setting.** I decided not to set in an existing D&D campaign world (Forgotten\nRealms, Greyhawk, etc.), but have reused many aspects of them for pragmatic\nreasons. The political landscape is rather important to the culture that has\nenabled a dedicated supernatural crime-solving organization to exist.\nSee [below](#setting) for further details on the setting.\n\n**Rules.** We use the Dungeons & Dragons Fifth Edition (D&D5E) rules,\nwhich are available online:\n* [5e.tools](https://5e.tools) &ndash;\n  A wealth of D&D5E rules in one place.\n* [dndbeyond.com](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) &ndash;\n  The official Wizards site for D&D5E rules.\n* [5esrd.com](https://www.5esrd.com/) &ndash;\n  A large subset of the core rules plus third party materials.\n* [dnd5e.wikidot.com](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/) &ndash; The DND 5th Edition\n  community wiki, with even more rules, including from splat books, such as the\n  class archetypes from *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*.\n\n**Characters.** Main points of character creation:\n* Try to hail from a unique territory and/or race. This helps diversity and world-building.\n* Have a reason in mind for why you are part of (or being recruited for) the SPI.\n* Have an unsolved mystery in your backstory.\n* SPI agents are currently 10th level. Anything in the 5E Player's Handbook or\n  [Xanathar's Guide to\n  Everything](https://www.amazon.com/Xanathars-Guide-Everything-Wizards-Team/dp/0786966114)\n  is fair game.\n\nThe current player characters are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[![{{p.title}}](){:style=\"max-height: 128px\"}{{p.title}}]({{site.baseurl}}{{p.url}})\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFor sweet sweet loot, see [Gear](gear).\n\nFor all characters in the story including NPCs, see the [Dossiers](dossiers).\n\n## Setting\n\nThe known world is a single large continent called Aecus, with various\nphenomena at the periphery which have hindered exploration, due to the\nincreasing inhospitality of the environment.\n\n[![](assets/images/aecus-map.jpg){:style=\"max-width: 100%; max-height: 80vh\"}](assets/images/aecus-map.jpg)\n\nThere are several countries which have enjoyed an uneasy peace for the past\nhalf century. One of D&D's primary conceits is that there are [many intelligent\nlife forms](creatures), which tend to differ culturally, not always getting along.\nAs such, territories are often divided on racial lines, and this campaign is no\nexception.\n\n* \\[N\\] [The Zephyr Federation](locales/zephyr) -\n  A windy and increasingly mountainous region to the north, inhabited by\n  diverse [dragonborn](creatures/dragonborn) races. Further north,\n  [dragons](creatures/dragons) dwell in the endless sky.\n* \\[S\\] [Elyria](locales/elyria) -\n  A sprawling forest in the deep south, home to [elves](creatures/elves) and other\n  sylvan races.\n* \\[E\\] [The Mountain and the Veldt](locales/mountain) -\n  A volcano and surrounding lands where [dwarves](creatures/dwarves) dwell.\n* \\[NE\\] [The Radiant Union of Pelor (RUP)](locales/rup) -\n  Inhospitable desert lands in the northeast governed by a benevolent\n  [paladin](https://dungeonsdragons.fandom.com/wiki/Paladin)\n  order known as the [Luminous Defenders](orgs/luminous-defenders).\n* \\[W\\] [Cognitutus](locales/cognitutus) -\n  A great [gnomish](creatures/gnomes) city, which disappeared during the\n  [War of Countless Dead](events/necromachy).\n* \\[SE\\] [The Selva Tribes](locales/selva) -\n  [Orcish](creatures/orcs) tribes that vie for control of southeast rainforest\n  territory.\n* \\[NW\\] [The Archipelago of Trell](locales/trell) -\n  A [fiendish](creatures/devils) island territory off the northwestern coast.\n* \\[SW\\] [Arallu](locales/arallu) -\n  A terrifying [undead](creatures/undead) realm to the southwest, about which\n  little is known.\n* [The Flux](locales/flux) - An uninhabitable zone bordering the nations.\n\n## The War of Countless Dead, and the Aecus Concord\n\nFor decades, [the world was at war](events/necromachy). The initial cause\nof the conflict is a topic of frequent historical debate&mdash;every nation\ntells it differently. After all, every country has reasons they hate the\nothers&mdash;especially their neighbors. But there are a few facts upon which\neveryone agrees:\n\n* All the nations of the world were involved.\n* No one's hands were clean.\n* The death toll was immeasurable.\n\nFifty years ago, [the war ended&mdash;suddenly](events/the-vanishing). All the\nsoldiers fighting on the warfront vanished without a trace, never to be seen\nagain. After that, the whole area became warped and twisted, resulting in what\nis now called the Flux.\n\nWith no armies left to deploy, the war was effectively over. The seven nations\nstill standing quickly met to sign a monumental peace treaty, the Aecus\nConcord. One of the stipulations of the treaty was the foundation of an\ninternational peacekeeping organization, consisting of individuals from all the\ninvolved nations, also dubbed the Aecus Concord. It consists of three subunits:\n\n* [**Supernatural Phenomena Investigation (SPI)**](orgs/spi), about whom this\n  story is concerned. These are the people who are called in when the situation\n  is too weird for the country's usual police force. Part detectives and part\n  spies, SPI is the \"[Interpol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol)\" of the\n  A.C. However, their central focus is not on mundane crime, politics or\n  intrigue, but only dangerous magic which might somehow threaten world peace.\n* [**Military Aid and Defense (MAD)**](orgs/mad), a mixed force offering benign\n  services to nations that request it. Members are volunteers from the armed\n  forces of constituent nations. MAD is the \"[U.N.\n  Peacekeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_peacekeeping)\"\n  force of the A.C.\n* [**Trade, Enforcement, Arbitration and Mediation (TEAM)**](orgs/team), the\n  diplomatic arm of the A.C., facilitating diplomatic relations and fair trade\n  between the nations. It enforces its\n  [arbitration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_arbitration)\n  decisions, as well as international regulations, largely via threat of trade\n  sanctions and embargoes, should a nation fail to comply. Which so far has\n  been rare.\n\nThe A.C. have created teleportation circles between major cities across Aecus,\nwhich all three branches regularly utilize in service to their goals. The\nteleportation circle spell can transport someone from any location to a\npermanent circle. A relatively common item known as a teleport crystal also\nexists (typically worth 10 gp) which anyone can use to activate a circle\nwithout spellcasting; in this way, the cities stay connected and in touch with\none another. While it is not cost effective to use the circles for mass trade\nof goods, or to commute between cities on a daily basis, they do provide many\ndiplomatic opportunities, as well as offering a rich courier market when the\ngoods or information being transported are of significant enough value.\n\n## The Supernatural Phenomena Investigators (SPI)\n\nThe use of magic seems to affect people's memories. The stronger the magic, the\nharder it is to recall later exactly what happened. People know magic exists,\nand can describe cantrips. But memory becomes hazy surrounding higher levels of\nmagic. The only exception is the caster of the spell in question: they are\noften unaffected, perhaps because it was their will manifest.\n\nAs such, magic and spellcasters are highly distrusted by most people. So much\nso, that when something magical is going on, the local authorities almost never\nwant to deal with it. That's where the [SPI](orgs/spi) comes in: an\ninternational, elite team of agents with unique magical skills and know-how.\nLeading the team is [Mallory](dossiers/mallory), the hard-boiled boss who's\nbeen running the operation for decades. The way he tells it, the SPI never used\nto get any respect, but he's worked very hard for a long time to change that.\nFinally, people are starting to take them seriously.\n\nUnfortunately, a few weeks ago, all veteran SPI teams disappeared during their\nrespective missions. All resurrection attempts fail. And meanwhile, [the SPI\nheadquarters in the Mountain was obliterated by fire](events/spi-fire),\ndestroying their files. Most of the existing SPI staff escaped, but it was a\nclose call. Mallory and the remaining staff do know something about previous\ninvestigations, but with magic involved, it's always tough to remember the\ndetails. The SPI is recruiting new investigators now, and operating from a\ntemporary but secure location until something more permanent can be\nreestablished.\n\n## Cases\n\n\n\n\n\n#\nDate\nIn-Game Dates\nTitle\nLevel\nLocation\nVictims\nCreatures\nCulprits\nRelics\n-->\nPlot\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n Session file \n{{p.session-number}}\n{{p.session-date}}\n{{p.when}}\n{{p.title}}\n{{p.description}}\n\n Case file \n{{p.title}}({{p.when}}) {{p.description}}\n\n{{p.level}}\n{{p.location}}\n{{p.victims}}\n{{p.creatures}}\n{{p.culprits}}\n{{p.relics}}\n-->\n\n\n\n", "id": "index"}, {"title": "Religion", "body": "## Creation myths\n\nDetails of exactly how the world came to be are heavily disputed by scholars of various religions and regions. Many of the world's creation myths heavily overlap, however, with common primordial forces and themes: Chaos[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_%28cosmogony%29) and/or Order[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aion_%28deity%29); Time[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronos) and/or Causality[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ananke); Thought[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metis_%28mythology%29) and/or Desire[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eros); the Earth[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia), Sea[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontus_%28mythology%29), Heavens[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_%28mythology%29) and/or Sky[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus_%28mythology%29); the Abyss[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartarus); and Darkness[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erebus), Night[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyx) and/or Day[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemera).\n\n### Draconic\n\n\n\nThe primordials according to dragons\n\n\nAccording to the [dragons](creatures/dragons) and [dragonborn](creatures/dragonborn), existing outside time is [Io](dossiers/io)[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apeiron) the Infinite, consisting of two aspects: Aion[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aion_%28deity%29) and Chaos[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_%28cosmogony%29#Greco-Roman_tradition). The current world of Aecus is but one iteration of the infinite cycle of time. At the beginning of this iteration, Aion's dual aspects of Time[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronos) and Causality[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ananke) created the physical world, including the Sky[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_%28mythology%29), Sea[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontus_%28mythology%29), and Earth[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia). Concurrently, from Chaos emerged Night[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyx), Darkness[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erebus), and the Abyss[\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartarus). The two [deities](creatures/eternals) [Bahamut](dossiers/bahamut) and [Tiamat](dossiers/tiamat) act as the divine manifestations of Aion and Chaos respectively. Their struggles for power yield the balance needed for the world to continue developing. Finally, a third but lesser dragon deity, [Sardior](dossiers/sardior), acts as the divine manifestion of Night, a patron for those seeking a third path: one of explicit balance between order and chaos.\n\nThere are variations of this myth amongst dragonkind:\n\n* Some dragons believe that Io and Chaos are separate entities, with Chaos being the endless void outside the universe, to which Io brings balance and order (i.e. reality). Those who subscribe to this view often see Bahamut as Io's manifestation directly, rather than Bahamut and Tiamat as Io's dual aspects. But there is bitter disagreement regarding which of the two dragon deities is more worthy of devotion. Some followers of Tiamat claim that Chaos is the only truly timeless&mdash;and therefore greatest&mdash;force.\n\n* Another variation believed by some dragons is that Tiamat is but one aspect of Chaos, the Abyss, with Sardior/Night being the other aspect. This view puts Tiamat and Sardior on equal footing, and beneath Bahamut in terms of seniority and importance.\n\n* Some followers of Sardior elevate It to the prime position of importance, believing that Sardior represents the pinnacle of the cosmos's evolution: a being of perfection sculpted from the cosmic genesis. In this view, Sardior represents the ultimate in personal apotheosis, a balanced and self-reliant power. But many dragons find this perspective to be heretical, reserving their primary reverence for the most ancient powers.\n\n* A common belief among dragons is that the goddess [Ioun](dossiers/ioun) is the personification of divine Causality, and secretly a dragon herself, making her worthy of draconic reverence.\n\nOne thing most dragons *do* agree on is that the three (or four, counting Ioun) draconic deities are the only true gods: the others are younger, lesser powers that emerged from the world itself, of little concern to dragonkind. Some even go so far as to claim that the other gods commonly worshipped throughout the world are nothing more than aspects of Bahamut, Tiamat, Sardior, Ioun, or some combination thereof.\n\n*GM's note: draconic philosophy and religious tradition is adapted from [Hesoid's version of ancient Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theogony).*\n\n### Human\n\n*GM's note: human philosophy and religious tradition is adapted from [Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism).*\n\n### Dwarven\n\n*GM's note: dwarven philosophy and religious tradition is adapted from [Anaximander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander#Theories) (610 - c. 546 BC).*\n\n### Selvan\n\n*GM's note: Selvan philosophy and religious tradition is adapted from [Etruscan religion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_religion) and [shamanic dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualism_in_cosmology), with some elements of [bipartite theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_%28theology%29).*\n\n### Elven\n\n*GM's note: Elven philosophy and religious tradition is adapted from the Pentemychos cosmogony of [Pherecydes of Syros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pherecydes_of_Syros) (6th century BC)\n\n### Arallu\n\n*GM's note: Arallu philosophy and religious tradition is adapted from [tripartite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripartite_%28theology%29) traditions: [triple deity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_deity), [maiden/mother/crone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Goddess_%28Neopaganism%29), [three fates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moirai), etc.*\n\n### Trell\n\n*GM's note: Trell lore is adapted from [Cainism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cainites), [Satanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanism#Church_of_Satan), and [Luciferianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferianism).*\n\n### Gnomish\n\n*GM's note: gnomish philosophy and religious tradition is adapted from [Pythagoreanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreanism) as well as [Orphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphism_%28religion%29) ancient greek mythological tradition.*\n\n### Halfling\n\n*GM's note: halfling philosophy and religion tradition is adapted from [Finnish paganism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_paganism), and other sources.*\n\n### Merfolk\n\n*GM's note: merfolk philosophy and religion tradition is adapted from the ancient Greek first principle of [Arche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arche), formalized by Plato and Aristotle, among other sources.*\n", "id": "religion"}, {"title": "Glossary", "body": "[](#bipedal)**bipedal**: a [creature](creatures) that walks on two legs.

But while the sun rises around\ndifferent elemental poles over the course of the year, creating seasons that\ndiffer by region, the phase of the moon looks the same to everyone worldwide.\nAnd so the new moon was chosen as the hallmark of a new lunar year.\n\n## Months of the year\n\nA year in Aecus consists of 368 days: 12 months of 30 days each, plus 8\ndedicated days for each of the elemental apexes (i.e. summer solstices), when\nthe sun sits highest in the sky centered at one of eight aligned elemental\norientations.\n\n|  # | Month        | Deity Honored                    | Domains          | Legend                                                             |\n|---:|--------------|----------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 01 | Gyrus        | [Io](../dossiers/io)             | All              | In the beginning was Io, origin of all that is divine.             |\n| 02 | Fons         | [Corellon](../dossiers/corellon) | Nature, Light    | Corellon sowed the seeds of nature, nourishing them with magic.    |\n| 03 | Solis        | [Pelor](../dossiers/pelor)       | Life, Light      | Pelor gave life to mortalkind, and reaped what Corellon sowed.     |\n| 04 | Cudo         | [Moradin](../dossiers/moradin)   | Light, War       | Moradin taught mortalkind to forge tools.                          |\n| 05 | Rixa         | [Gruumsh](../dossiers/gruumsh)   | War, Tempest     | But with resources came conflict and destruction.                  |\n| 06 | Vis          | [Kord](../dossiers/kord)         | Tempest          | The strong survived, weathering the storms.                        |\n| 07 | Avium        | [Melora](../dossiers/melora)     | Tempest, Nature  | And the wilderness endured, defiant and untamed.                   |\n| 08 | Luna         | [Sehanine](../dossiers/sehanine) | Nature, Trickery | Mortalkind learned to thrive in harmony with the natural world.    |\n| 09 | Casus        | [Avandra](../dossiers/avandra)   | Trickery, Life   | As their luck changed, they began new journeys.                    |\n| 10 | Fatum        | [Nerull](../dossiers/nerull)     | Trickery, Death  | But all journeys end with death's embrace.                         |\n| 11 | Mysteria     | [Vecna](../dossiers/vecna)       | Death, Knowledge | Is there a secret way to cheat fate?                               |\n| 12 | Idea         | [Erathis](../dossiers/erathis)   | Knowledge, War   | As secrets are revealed, can Aecans build a better world together? |\n\n## Days of the week\n\nThe Aecus common calendar uses five-day weeks, with six weeks per month:\n\n* Skyday is always on the 1st, 6th, 11th, 16th, 21st, and 26th of the month.\n* Forgeday is always on the 2nd, 7th, 12th, 17th, 22nd, and 27th of the month.\n* Woodsday is always on the 3rd, 8th, 13th, 18th, 23rd, and 28th of the month.\n* Kinsday is always on the 4th, 9th, 14th, 19th, 24th, and 29th of the month.\n* Evensday is always on the 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, 25th, and 30th of the month.\n* Apexday is used to refer to the days of the eight elemental apexes.\n\n## The solar and lunar cycle\n\nA curious feature of Aecus's solar/lunar annual cycle is that the sun does not\nmove at a constant speed around the elemental poles, but rather spends more\ntime each year near the Arenan quadrant. Some scholars believe this is due to\n[Pelor](../dossiers/pelor)'s affinity for the elements of Air and Fire. As a\nconsequence, some nations have an imbalance of seasons, as noted in the\nfollowing table.\n\nFurthermore, the moon does not move through its phases evenly throughout the\nyear, but rather spends substantially more time waxing than waning, reaching\nits fullest at the midpoint between the Arenan and Ignan solar apexes, and\nits newest at the midpoint between the Terran and Glacian solar apexes.\n\n|  When | Event               | Element(s)  | SummerSolstice              | AutumnEquinox               | WinterSolstice              | SpringEquinox               |\n|------:|---------------------|-------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| 12-01 | \ud83c\udf11 New Moon         |             |                                 |                                 |                                 |                                 |\n| 01-02 | \ud83e\uddca Glacian Apex     | Earth+Water | [Arallu](../locales/arallu)^    | [Selva](../locales/selva)^      | [RUP](../locales/rup)^          | [Trell](../locales/trell)^      |\n| 02-03 | \ud83c\udf0a Aquan Apex       | Water       | [Ocean](../locales/cognitutus)  | [Elyria](../locales/elyria)     | [Mountain](../locales/mountain) | [Zephyr](../locales/zephyr)     |\n| 03-04 | \ud83c\udf00 Procellan Apex   | Water+Air   | [Trell](../locales/trell)       | [Arallu](../locales/arallu)     | [Selva](../locales/selva)       | [RUP](../locales/rup)           |\n| 04-05 | \ud83c\udf13 Waxing Half-Moon |             |                              |                              |                              |                              |\n| 05-06 | \ud83c\udf2a Auran Apex       | Air         | [Zephyr](../locales/zephyr)     | [Ocean](../locales/cognitutus)  | [Elyria](../locales/elyria)     | [Mountain](../locales/mountain) |\n| 06-07 | \u23f3 Arenan Apex      | Air+Fire    | [RUP](../locales/rup)\\*         | [Trell](../locales/trell)\\*     | [Arallu](../locales/arallu)\\*   | [Selva](../locales/selva)\\*     |\n| 07-08 | \ud83c\udf15 Full Moon        |             |                              |                              |                              |                              |\n| 08-09 | \ud83d\udd25 Ignan Apex       | Fire        | [Mountain](../locales/mountain) | [Zephyr](../locales/zephyr)     | [Ocean](../locales/cognitutus)  | [Elyria](../locales/elyria)     |\n| 09-10 | \ud83c\udf17 Waning Half-Moon |             |                              |                              |                              |                              |\n| 10-11 | \ud83c\udf0b Magman Apex      | Fire+Earth  | [Selva](../locales/selva)       | [RUP](../locales/rup)           | [Trell](../locales/trell)       | [Arallu](../locales/arallu)     |\n| 11-12 | \ud83c\udf33 Terran Apex      | Earth       | [Elyria](../locales/elyria)     | [Mountain](../locales/mountain) | [Zephyr](../locales/zephyr)     | [Ocean](../locales/cognitutus)  |\n\n^ Short season: 61 days rather than the usual 92 in other regions.  \n\\* Long season: 122 days rather than the usual 92 in other regions.\n\nSee the\n[Equilibrium calendar spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nPtq4H6Hc4krrQXcpF5PJNLf2_-q9p11HShezd5jquc/edit)\nfor a full breakdown of the Aecus Concord calendar, and how it\naligns with the various regional calendars discussed below.\n\n## Regional calendars\n\nEven with a common calendar system, many regions also use their own calendars\ncolloquially.

But unlike others, the elves celebrate moderation\nrather than extremes. As such, rather than marking when solstices occur, they\ncelebrate seasonal midpoints, illustrative of their philosophy of balance.\n\nYears are counted since the last planting of the World Tree, with each\nplanting referred to as a Cycle&mdash;e.g. Year 985, Cycle 37.\n\nMonths are divided into 10-day segments known as tendays, with no names per\nday.

I am uncertain of its origin, or I would credit it here.*\n\nIn remote regions of the world, the last remaining plinths, monoliths, and statues of the great giant empires bow their heads in desolate obscurity. Where once those empires sprawled across all lands, now the giants dwell in isolated tribes and clans.\n\nGiants are almost as old as [dragons](dragons), which were still young when the giants' heavy feet first shook the foundations of the world. As they spread across new lands, giants and dragons fought bitter generational wars that nearly brought both sides low. No living giant remembers what started the conflict, but myths and tales of their race's glorious dawn are still sung in their steadings and holdfasts, vilifying the primeval wyrms. Giants and dragons continue to harbor grudges against one another, and it is seldom that they will meet or occupy the same area without a fight.\n\n## The Ordning\n\nEach of the main giant races\u2014the cloud, fire, frost, hill, stone, and storm giants\u2014are related by common elements of history, religion, and culture. They view one another as kindred, keeping any inherent animosity over territory and ambition to a minimum.\n\nGiants belong to a caste structure called the ordning. Based on social class and highly organized, the ordning assigns a social rank to each giant. By understanding its place in the ordning, a giant knows which other giants are inferior or superior to it, since no two giants are equal. Each of the giant races analyzes a different combination of skills or qualities to determine the ordning. Giants make excelling in these qualities the purpose of their lives.\n\nAt the highest level of the ordning, the races of the giants are also ranked according to status. Storm giants are the highest in the ordning, followed by cloud giants, fire giants, frost giants, stone giants, hill giants, and finally giant kin such as fomorians, ettins, and ogres. Regardless of a giant's rank among its own race, the chief of a hill giant tribe is inferior to the most common of stone giants. The lowest ranked giant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant of an inferior type.

No!\" he explains, and tries again, this time producing the corpose of Letharil Galere.\n\nFreki transforms into hybrid form, and moves up to the ghost and owlbear.\n\nOz attacks Janus with his dagger of venom, misses, and fancy footworks away from the ghost toward the owlbear samurai. \"You're next, you limp-cocked pig rapist!\" Oz taunts the dark-Oz-ghost. Then he stabs the Hornblade into the owlbear!\n\n\n\nOwlbear: \"Oz! What are you doing, I know I annoy with my spells, but please!\"\n\nBec casts *dispel magic* on Cronus! His conjured will tries to resist but fails, and he dissipates. So does the shadow Letharil, and the residual shadow energy around the owlbear. Bec realizes that all the effects are linked in a chain.\n\n\n\nSartus comes back and stands next to Bec. \"Thank you, and I'm sorry. But it's all up to you now&mdash;I need to save my magic for when we get the Book.\" And he draws a longsword.\n\nThe dark Oz-ghost moves up to the OG Oz: \"Let's dance!\" she smirks.\n\nStabs Oz impotently.\n\nOwlbear: \"I don't know how to deal with that!\" He steps back, and attacks the dark Oz-ghost. Hits, but it's only half effective. He does, however, see through the shadow conjuration effect. But he doesn't know what it is...\n\nCal is possessed by Janus. He throws sartus out of the room with the whip.\n\nCallie casts *spiritual weapon* next to the Oz-ghost lady, and hits her! It is fully effective. There is a flash, and they see another woman in gold and green in a negative instant. Only momentarily.\n\nPhoebe finishes casting a summoning spell, and six pixie knights appear with shortbows. They shoot at the dark-Oz ghost, but only one hits.\n\nPhoebe then casts *dispel magic* on Janus-inside-Cal. Oz makes a choice to cleverly sidestep the challenge of continuing to battle the dark-Oz ghost... and they disperse!\n\nBec then dispels the unconscious Tybalt, who is the only remaining shadow conjuration, and the spell collapses.\n\nVondal-as-Owlbear: \"What is with these awesome sunglasses?\"\n\nMeanwhile, Phoebe *heal*s Cal.\n\nOz: 22 deception\n\"You cockroach shit-sucking cowards! We're your relief sent by the Queen. Now open the door before we break it down and report your beligerence to the Queen.\"\n\nUnfortunately, this is not a believable lie for multiple reasons.\n\nMale guard (sounding amused): \"Heh heh hmm hmm\"\n\nFemale guard: \"If you come in here, we will be forced to fight you. We have our orders.\"\n\nOz suddenly remembers about his monkey, and decides to go back and look for him quickly. He finds the monkey in statue form lying on the ground just outside the treasury building. When he picks up the monkey statue, he feels a wave of assurance and relief wash over him.\n\nLorissa: \"If you take this book, it will do immeasurable harm. Nothing good will come of it.\"\n\nVondal-as-Owlbear: \"Sartus, explain why this is not bad plan. Sartus maybe not most popular, but pretty big brain boy over here!\"\n\nSartus explains the plan: erase the writings in the Book.\n\nOz (panache): \"Look into your heart, you know we can be trusted. I know it can be hard to bend the rules sometimes, but when all this is said and done, you don't want to have regrets that you didn't do everything you could to save the Queen.\"\n\nBook is encased in translucent crystal.\n\nTODO -- describe how the party got the Book out of there, and performed the ritual to erase the writings.\n\nMeanwhile, Oz steals the Ioun Stone of Mastery! But he accidentally cracks it when he uses the Hornblade to split the crystal casing. It has 9/10 HP remaining.\n\n---------------------\n\n## Callie's Journal\n\nThere is some heavy-duty illusion magic going on here with Dark Oz/Janus/Tybalt. Sartus is totally taken in, maybe because this is what he feared would happen. He yells at us to flee, and runs towards the door himself.\n\nThese things are illusory, but whatever they really are, they're sending waves of terror out at us. I cast Calm Emotions at level 2 to try to reduce the effect.\n\nA giant appears and tosses two things out of its pack or pocket: a samurai owlbear and Bec's father, all disconnected from the tree and looking very undead.\n\nI cast Spiritual Weapon at level 4, so damage is 2d8 plus my spellcasting modifier (7).\n\nAfter the battle, Freki and Vondal were pretty wounded, so I cast Prayer of Healing at level 5. 4+5+4+8+7+(7) = 35\n\nAs we all pray/cast ritual magic on the book, I am forced to contribute 3 more spell slots toward the spell. I contribute one level 4, one level 3, and one level 1.\n", "id": "events/case-12e11"}, {"title": "The Age of Endless War", "datestamp": "00-05-00", "when": "The 5th age", "body": "The time before the founding of the [Aecus Concord](aecus-concord), during which many wars were fought, including the [War of Countless Dead](necromachy).\n\n*GM's note: this era is based on Greek Mythology's [Iron Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_Man).*\n", "id": "events/age-05"}, {"title": "Reality Unmade", "datestamp": 999999, "when": "?", "body": "Will the [Flux](../locales/flux) consume everything, like langoliers eating away at the edges of the world until nothing remains but chaos?\n", "id": "events/reality-unmade"}, {"title": "The Breach", "datestamp": "50-04-25/3b", "when": "case 09", "body": "Referred to by MAD as \"the Incident\".\n\nSee [Case 09: Amalgamation and Anathema](case-09) file.\n", "id": "events/the-breach"}, {"title": "Timeline", "body": "\n\n\nFor a calendar view, see the [Calendar](../calendar) page.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "events/index"}, {"title": "[12e08] Thrilla in the Willa", "description": "Fought Isis and the Guardian", "datestamp": "50-05-25/08", "when": "AC50 Rixa 25", "session-number": 53, "session-date": "2022-10-29", "session-event": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1299318844229169/", "body": "Thanks to the *tree stride* power of [Phoebe](../dossiers/phoebe) the [Hamadryad](../creatures/dryads#hamadryads), the SPI agents and allies reached what they believed to be the heart of the [World Tree](../relics/yggdrasil), the secret womb of the Fruit of Life, only to find that the vision of the Fruit was a powerful illusion, masking a pit into which they would have fallen, had they naively approached the Fruit.\n\nBeyond its threshold, [Freki](../dossiers/freki) sees [Enoki](../dossiers/enoki) and his poodle moth Cornelius entangled in an enormous thornbush, and hears him crying out for help!\n\nMeanwhile, the others see half of Freki's disappear as he stands at the threshold. Moving quickly to investigate, everyone save [Vondal](../dossiers/vondal) (who projects into his familiar Murky) advances toward the threshold's edge until they can see what was going on.\n\nFreki shoots a grappling arrow at Enoki and Cornelius, hooking them and pulling the duo out of the thorns, though not without some painful tears to Cornelius's wings. Enoki has free-floating *How Dare You* energy, but is more concerned about healing Cornelius. Fortunately, Enoki is able to heal him quickly.\n\nThe other agents continue to advance cautiously until they are outside the threshold... when they suddenly hear a voice behind them. The illusion dissipates, and standing at the edge of the previously concealed pit is a fully armored knight clad in green armor made of wood and bone:\n\n[![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e7/d4/d0/e7d4d0eed01f418dd94354a1d0d5219d.jpg){:style=\"width:200px\"}](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/283375001525217177/)\n\nSpeaking in a masculine voice, the knight demands they cease their attempts to interfere with the Fruit, or face destruction. \"Leave or perish. The fruit must not be disturbed.\" The scholars in the group recognize this figure as a Green Knight, a supernatural fey creature summoned to aid the cause of the wilds in times of need.\n\nBec kneels and explains to the knight that we need the Fruit or the tree will perish anyway.\n\nThe hamadryad Phoebe says, \"Stand down, sir knight. It is as she says.\" The knight, however, says he is bound to protect and says we will be destroyed if we persist.\n\nBec asks Phoebe if the Seed can be moved without disturbing it.\n\nFreki attempts to point his drawn bow at the Seed, but he can't actually see it.\n\nCallie asks the knight who summoned him, but he ignores everyone's questions and says this is his final warning. Enoki agrees that's a great question, but also tells Callie the green knight won't answer because \"they never do. They're really one-track.\"\n\n[Oz](../dossiers/oz) slyly approaches the knight, playing dumb, until suddenly \\*stab!\\* he slays the knight in one blow!\n\nAs soon as the knight discorporates,\n\nFreki's bird companions [Hugin](../dossiers/hugin) and [Munin](../dossiers/munin) speak in Freki's mind, warning him that there are unseen threats in the Megil'ram (which Freki somehow mentally understands to mean \"Thornbush\" or literally \"Wall of Swords\" in elven). They dive from the canopy overhead into the thornbush, and a flock of songbirds (which Freki recognizes as [shrikes](../creatures/shrikes)) burst forth from the bush and fly away in fright.\n\nAt the same time, a series of mental attacks on Oz commences. Oz feels his body begin to pulse and stretch&mdash;some foul magic is happening to him. Resisting with all his might, the disturbance dies down... and then begins again as strong as ever as a figure concealed head to toe in a cloak of leaves, feathers, and bone appears at the edge of the thornbush, crying out in frustration.\n\n[![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NZhXneP2ebs/WqGsLjOZsDI/AAAAAAAAV54/trjq-bZb6nI2yVtYfMxgWGptn7L8AAdtwCK4BGAYYCw/s1600/druid-2.jpg){:style=\"width:200px\"}](http://www.castlemacdnd.com/2018/03/lost-mine-of-phandelver-character.html)\n\nBec theorizes on the spot that at least two different people must be using magic on Oz, since one person could not have hit him twice with such a powerful spell so quickly. Unfortunately for our plucky murder machine, the second time he does not muster sufficient resistance, and he feels his body and mind crunched into a tiny metaphysical ball and reformed into... a [giant narwhal](https://www.5esrd.com/database/creature/giant-narwhal/)!\n\n\"Stop!\" the figure shouts at the agents. \"This is the moment I've been waiting for. I cannot let you do this!\"\n\nFreki demands that she/they turn Oz back. When she refuses, Freki attacks, transforming, tearing into the spellcaster and knocking off her mask with two powerful claw attacks. Under the skull mask, they see:\n\n[![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2f/b5/d0/2fb5d05ce538861218a9618d13f1da32.png){:style=\"width:200px\"}](image-source: https://www.pinterest.com/pin/3659243437521066/)\n\n\"[Isis](../dossiers/isis-raksh)! What are you doing?\" exclaims [Eixam](../dossiers/eixam). Callie and others get the impression that Eixam is surprised and frustrated that Isis is here, doing this. Eixam transforms into a swarm of vermin: locusts, spiders, scorpions, and centipedes, rolling over Isis and nearby thorns, devouring everything in their path, and lacing Isis with innumerable bites and stings.\n\nOz gets turned back from a narwhal (how?). Back in human form, he clambors to his feet, tumbles over to the figure, and does a bunch of damage.\n\n[Vondal](../dossiers/vondal) burns Isis with a volley of *scorching rays*.\n\nEnoki begins casting a summoning spell...\n\n[Callie](../dossiers/callie) casts *bless* on herself, Oz, and Freki, then summons a *spiritual weapon* and slices up Isis some more.\n\n\"No! Isis!\" exclaims Phoebe, rushing forward to cast *cure wounds* on her!\n\nMeanwhile, the thornbush grows supernaturally fast, straining toward all the interlopers, and twines itself around Isis to form a protective barrier from further attacks. But the swarm of Eixam eats through the bush as fast as it can grow in the area surrounding Isis, and [Sartus](../dossiers/sartus-morningdew) casts *[command plants](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/command-plants/)* to further interfere with the thornbush's attempts.\n\nStill bleeding profusely, Isis desperately reaches out to touch something unseen next to her as she casts some kind of *giant growth* spell, which radiates outward... A [faerie dragon](../creatures/dragons#faerie-dragons) appears next to her, and promptly begins to balloon to a much larger size, along with three remaining shrikes from within the thornbush.\n\n[PSA break!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okQYO10MT3c)\n\nIn one smooth motion after completing the casting of her spell, Isis swings up onto the faerie dragon's back... but Oz does not miss the opportunity to tear into Isis, who thusly lays across the dragon's back, dying.\n\nThe faerie dragon waggles its eyebrows, flicks its tongue a couple of times, turns invisible again along with Isis, and casts another *polymorph* on Oz, this time turning him into... a [crimson jellyfish](https://www.5esrd.com/database/creature/jellyfish-crimson/)! [Suffocation rules](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/hazards/suffocation/), here we come!\n\nBec, concerned about the danger now posted by the three enormous shrikes, charms one of the two birds near here with her [hypnotic gaze](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wizard:enchantment#toc1).\n\nOz, dissatisfied with his squishy existence, decides to end it all by declining to hold his breath (crimson jellyfish only \"breathe\" water according to D&D5E rules), and begins to drown.\n\nEnoki completes his spell, and a buttload of mushrooms spring up from the tree trunk floor in a huge radius around him. He commands them to push back against the thornbush, and its sharp vines begin to recede.\n\nFreki exercises his conscious will, takes control of the beast, and reverts to his elfin form. He then kills jelly Oz, causing him to return to his natural form also.\n\nThe faerie dragon, from higher up in the air above the edge of the thornbush, offers to parlay in a cute and resounding voice: \"You don't have to do this. It's not too late to talk.\"\n\nAfter some appeals from Vondal that the SPI needs the Fruit to **Save the World!\u2122**, with the dragon seeming unconvinced, the party reluctantly agrees to parlay. Even Eixam seems willing to talk, as they regain control of themselves enough to reform into a [bipedal](../glossary#bipedal) shape.\n\nThe dragon appears with Isis still slumped across his back. \"You're being dumb, you know.

FIND OUT NEXT TIME\n\n-----------------------------\n\n## Callie's Journal\n\n*Rumble in the Jungle*  \n--OR--  \n*Cat-tastrophe*\n\nThe battle situation has developed not necessarily to the party's advantage.\n\nOz stabbed the centaur. The centaur looks bad but not dead.\n\nFreki has \"attuned\" one of his remaining four arrows, so he has three left that are not attuned.\n\nVondal directed Murky up toward the horse-man.\n\nBec does Magic Missile and hits it!\n\nI attack with Spiritual Weapon! It glances off the demon's thick hide, boo. I move a little over to my left so I can affect both enemies with my Spirit Guardians. They don't get an opportunity to swipe at me because they're both slowed, haha.\n\nThe monster lady saves and takes only 5 points of radiant damage from the Spirit Guardians. Then she starts casting a 6th-level divine spell called Blade Barrier that slices through four of us. She is a shaman. She also moves towards everyone.\n\nThe centaur turns into a were-tiger-centaur and says \"You all stink of the gods. How fortunate for me.\" Then he does something and we feel a pull at our souls. Bec failed the save, so she feels...depleted in some ineffable, non-numeric kind of way. Everyone else is OK for now. Murky is unaffected. Hugin and Munin are affected somehow, although Freki doesn't find out about that until later.\n\nOz feels ice climbing up his legs and needs a strength save. He fails and takes 9 points of cold damage and his speed is reduced.\n\nCal fails his save against the soul-stealer too. He strikes out at Talos and hits! He is bleeding from all over his body. His second strike runs Talos through! But then Talos says, \"Pathetic!\" and gets back to his feet.\n\nTalos screams a battle cry and I feel a divine energy of some kind. Cal feels that he is tapping into Cal's power somehow.\n\nOz attacks. Talos is just death-saving at this point. Oz is unable to finish him off, so he calls Monkey Caesar into play.\n\nCal realizes that Talos will live as long as he is enraged, so he calls out, \"Stop the rage!\" But he's been knocked down and is prone.\n\nFreki fires his special arrow point-blank into Talos. It does damage, although the creature kind of shrugs it off. He tries to climb up the neck and doesn't succeed but doesn't fall off.\n\nVondal banishes the enemies. They're gone for a little while. We get the opportunity to rearrange our battle order and prepare actions.\n\nI break concentration on my Spirit Guardians and cast Calm Emotions at fifth level on Talos as soon as they reappear (it has to be 5th or above to hit Talos because he has an Ion Stone or something that absorbs spells 4th level or lower). He barely manages to throw off the calm, but he looks tired now and the cold doesn't return.\n\nVondal did Shocking Grasp with Murky.\n\nOz finally gets his natural 20 roll that gives him some ridiculous attack with his horn blade. He cuts Talos into halves (104 points of damage, whoooaaaaaa).\n\nBec attempts to cast a spell on the orc, but she's resistant to magic and nothing happens.\n\nFreki claws at the orc. He does a total of 24 damage. \n\nThe orc casts Revivify on Talos, knitting his halves back together. She then changes back into an orc from her other form.\n\nTalos gets to his feet and casts Heal. He puts his ax on his back and says, \"Enough! I yield for now.\"\n\nOz says, \"He really pulled himself together!\"\n\nIn accordance with Selva custom, Talos allows us to name our terms (\"war price\").\n\nCal is keeping his sword. Freki takes the ax and gives it to Cal, who hands it back (sensing as he does so that Talos is relieved to have it back). All Cal wanted was his original sword back! Talos mentions that we don't even know what we are.\n\nFreki says, \"We want the bracers. And we want you to leave this space. And also, what is it you think we are?\"\n\nHe says, \"You are godlings. If you become like the others, I will have to kill you. What I don't understand is how you don't know.\"\n\nTalos stole the god-ling-ness??? from Bec and Cal during the fight. That's why they felt they had lost something.\n\nFreki asks, \"Why do you want to kill the gods?\"\n\n\"Because they deserve it. You could all join me. You are worthy to join the Malosi.\"\n\nHugin and Munin land on Freki's shoulders. He feels comforted, aww. He checks in with them. They say something happened to them that they do not understand, but they're OK now.\n\nA big suit of armor comes clanking up to us with Sabrina on its shoulder. The orc turns into a raven and flies over to the armor, landing on the other shoulder.\n\nTalos promises not to harm the people of this village. He says again that we could join his tribe if they want. Then he says to Freki, \"I'm glad at least one person from your village was strong enough to survive.\" Freki notices that he has a very self-satisfied smirk as he does so. Then Talos rushes over to the armor and they all vanish.\n\nMarigold apologizes for being unable to do anything. She explains that they were unable to move or possibly didn't exist for a little while. Bec asks if they saw the suit of armor, but Marigold doesn't recall. We (not Oz) remembers the suit of armor from when we met Sabrina before. It protects her.\n\nBec is thinking they might have had their memories modified or been banished, although all we saw was them running into the trees, so we don't know for sure.\n\nA dwarf villager opines that whatever happened to them \"felt psionic.\" Bec says Sabrina may be a githzerai, and the dwarf is like, \"I knew it!!!\"\n\nVondal goes to check on Mallory. He's still there, right where we left him. He tells Sima's doppelganger that she can imprint on him, with the price being that she has to figure out a better way of doing things.\n\nMarigold says, \"We're changing the rotation then, so I can leave!\"\n\nOz blabs that Bec took Isis's body and has it, so Bec apologizes for her cultural insensitivity and she and Callie take the body out of the portable hole and lay it out so they can see it. The villagers are all shocked.\n\nVondal mentions that he's older than he looks, like the villager who looks like a child. Later, she's munching on some of Vondal's cookies. Freki also notices that suddenly she has a ring that she didn't have before. And hey, Vondal is missing a ring!\n\nVondal orders the kid to give the ring back before she gets hurt. He gives her a cookie because rewarding bad behavior is what grandpas do. Michael gives Allen an inspiration point for that! Vondal proceeds to give the kid a whole grandpa lecture along with it. He doesn't roll well, so he takes her word for it that she's totally taking it all in and learning.\n\nChangelings are dead forever once they're dead, so there's no chance we could revive Fake Isis.\n\nAina (?) asks whether we knew that centaur. Freki explains that he sensed our innate goodness, or at least trying-to-be-goodness. Callie feels like maybe she knows something, but can't quite grasp what. But she doesn't think Talos was lying or mistaken; he was right in some way.\n\nThe villagers want to know what happened with Isis. There seems to be no point in keeping anything from them, especially since Vondal is going to spill it anyway. Bec says something about the cult of the white crane and the dwarf guy objects that it isn't a cult, but a \"force of nature\" that has \"done nothing but benefit us.\" Isis was the leader of the village, but she was deposed for saying bad words about the white crane.\n\nWe explain about the blood mage gnome that was inside the hamadryad Phoebe and how Isis tried to protect him after he was expelled from Phoebe's body. He escaped, but Oz killed Isis.\n\nAina says to Vondal and Bec that she knows the centaur, or at least her double does. Talos has attacked the Lord of the Devils, Azmodeus, many times. She asks if Bec/Vondal knows why he would do that. Vondal tells her that they met him once before in some kind of demiplane. Talos expressed admiration for Cal's sword and was angry at us for invading his territory. Bec recalls that Azmodeus might be almost a god himself, and Talos seems to hate any kind of god. Aina tells Vondal and Bec to keep their conversation to themselves.\n\nVondal and Bec head off to take a look at the destroyed \"door\" to the village. Seeing them, Callie joins them. Vondal wants to dump some flux into the door. Callie casts Augury (knowledge domain, once per day) to ask Erathis whether this will have a good result or not. Weal! It's a go!\n\nVondal's magic gets sucked up and woven into a wild magic door. Aina is shocked that Vondal is so powerful.\n\n### Open questions and next steps\n\n- Should we try to recover Sima's body and see if we can revive her? Or will one of us volunteer to be the anchor for Sima's double?\n- What happened to Mallory, and is there anything we can do for him? Vondal wants to find Mallory's doppelganger.\n- What was Talos talking about?\n- Vondal has a big lead on what happened to the SPI agents, and will want to follow up on it.\n- Freki wants to find out what happened to Hugin and Munin.

She is shocked to see them appear, but moves to block them from advancing any closer.\n\nSkyfall: \"If you kill her, the Tree dies.\"\n\nVondal remembers that this situation is a lot like that one time with the evil entity possessing that guy... just gotta get it out of there and kill it!\n\nVondal asks others for advice, but people aren't sure... then Stormseeker speaks up.\n\nLorissa (quietly): \"Banishment.\"\n\nVondal: \"Banishment? **I have that!**\"\n\nAnd he immediately casts it.\n\nFreki wants a page of the Book to incorporate into an arrow of slaying. Celes thinks it's a brilliant idea.\n\nOz points his weapons at the Queen: \"Creature! You are a yeasty onion-eyed ratfucker. Get out here and face me!\"\n\nZuggtmoy: \"Untie me and it would be my pleasure.\"\n\nVondal casts it! He busts through the first layer of her will. Then, Feymist begins to flow from the Tree into him! He is chaotically empowered, and pushes through the *second* layer of her will!\n\nAn enormous black ooze emerges from the Queen! It gushes all over Callie, who was standing in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\n* Oz uses decanter to wash off Callie.\n* Freki shoots a lightning arrow at the ooze but it's immune to lightning.\n* Vondal manipulates reality to make the ooze be Freki's oathbow sworn enemy, which is currently still [Erasmus the faerie dragon](../dossiers/erasmus).\n* The ooze takes the form of a faerie dragon (still black oozy).\n\nVondal makes Bec super lucky (all 20s), and everyone else critically unlucky (all 1s).\n\nLorissa casts *fireshield* as she bladesings, but trips (auto-1!) and falls into the black ooze. :-(\n\nVondal tries to fix it, causing three wild surges. Vondal grows large, is followed by ethereal music, and immediately teleports 20 feet.\n\nThe black ooze makes nine pseudopod attacks! But all nine miss, since it was critically unlucky.\n\nOz attacks the ooze with his swords. The ooze fails the Con save vs poison, then fails another Con save vs necrotic.\n\nCeles still wants to grab a page from the Book and give it to Freki to incorporate into an arrow of slaying. Bec stops her from touching the Book directly, concerned it would corrupt Celes, then rips out a page using *mage hand*, thrusting it toward Freki. \n\nFreki dexterously grabs the torn-out page of the Book and wraps it around one of his arrows-of-slaying-in-the-making. He swift shot shoots it. The ooze is completely obliterated! But his hand feels oily, and it's not going away...\n\nCal tries to whip grapple the Hornblade (35 Athletics!).\n\nOz: \"What the fuck?\"  \nCal: The Book must be destroyed.\"\n\nOz manages to weasel the Hornblade out of the whip's grasp (39 Acrobatics!). As he frees the blade, he flips around acrobatically, bringing the sword down... ON THE BOOK!\n\nAs this happens, Bec reflexively drops the Book (which she was still holding with *mage hand*), which lands still open, as Oz's downthrust drives unerringly toward the Book's spine...\n\nVondal, concerned he might have been created by the Book, or even be an aspect of the Book itself, tries to channel luck to protect it using Lucky (which normally can only be used to protect himself)... but it doesn't work. Whew!\n\n\n\n...and the Hornblade pierces Freki straight through the back.\n\nOz does 109 critical damage. But Freki in hybrid form has 110 hit points! He has 1 hit point left.\n\nThe party quickly acts to heal him:\n* Vondal uses Callie's 5th level *cure wounds* from his ring of spell storing to heal Freki for 16 HP, and also heals him with a charge from his Wand of Healing.\n* Celes, a paladin of the ancients, uses her *lay on hands* power to heal Lorissa's acid damage, then heals Freki for 40 more HP.\n\nCeles then inspects the Book and the Queen for lingering traces of evil, but finds none. However, Cal is skeptical, sensing some subconscious doubt in Celes's analysis of the Book, and calls her on it. She looks again at the Book, and now notices a tiny gem of something evil still there. Lorissa casts *remove curse* on the Book, and everyone feels a tiny metaphysical cracking sensation, and Celes believes the Book to be now fully and truly cleansed. At least, Freki's oily hand feels better now!\n\nAs everyone frees the Queen from her chains, an argument can be heard through the throne room doors. The [Warforged](../relics/warforged) bursts through the door with two of her elite hunters ([1](../dossiers/caraway-maplehorn) and [2](../dossiers/juniper-tumbleclove)), having pushed past a flustered [Anastasia Starflower](../dossiers/anastasia-starflower).\n\n......................\n\nSix days later, the agents are tracking the [Sima doppelganger](../dossiers/amisa-swiftaxe) east through the Deepwood.\n\nAnd Freki senses that they in turn are being followed...\n", "id": "events/case-12e12"}, {"title": "[12e03] The Golden Path", "description": "Began climbing the World Tree; found a blighted area", "datestamp": "50-05-24/03", "when": "AC50 Rixa 24", "session-number": 48, "session-date": "2022-06-03", "session-event": "https://www.facebook.com/events/4357338237702844/", "body": "With [Sartus Morningdew](../dossiers/sartus-morningdew), the agents start climbing the [World Tree](../relics/yggdrasil), staying together.

He got the impression the light was very big, and therefore probably very far away.\n3. They made their way through the vibrant underwater city to the Rockwell family manor. On the way, Callie insinuated that she was bringing these non-gnomes back to her family to serve as dinner. The driver seemed nonplussed. Oz discerned via innuendo that the driver had some criminal connections, but did not understand what they were trying to ask him.\n4. The manor was strangely unoccupied, with no servants nor family to be found. The Cornucopia was sitting in a dominant position in the first-floor foyer, having completely crushed the teleportation circle there.\n5. After exploring several lavish rooms, the agents happened upon the study, where a man named Reginald Auror sat at the desk, writing some notes. He recognized Callie and was unsurprised to see her.\n6. The agents learned Auror was a security consultant hired to keep the Cornucopia safe from any and all threats. He had only just begun his assessment and plan to do this. He was initially gruff, but became slightly less rude as time went on. Auror claimed that Callie's parents were out at an important meeting, but did not know what it was\u2014only that they would be back later that evening.\n7. Auror mentioned \"horrors from the deep\" multiple times during their conversation. After Auror left the study, they inspected the document that he had been writing. It was a sketch of the area around the Cornucopia, with some jotted notes about protective spells. In one margin was drawn a cartoonish-looking fish monster.\n8. Callie offered everyone snacks; the agents went to the kitchenette. There, they encountered Raliana, the long-time Rockwell family chef.

Orbach declined, saying he cannot find missing objects\u2014only obtain them when their location is already known to him. Sartus persisted: \"We heard a rumor that you already obtained this item once before\u2014does that not make it more feasible in this case?\" Orbach glanced askance at Tremere. \"I don't know what you mean.\" But Tremere looked pissed and stomped out of the room. Orbach, sarcastically to Sartus: \"Thanks for that,\" and he went into the foyer.\n* The lich led the party to the body.

He seemed mystically winded.\n  * Bram the Blithe had not been seen since he left to purportedly take a dump after his big speech.\n  * Alex Orbach emerged onto the balcony from the 2nd floor Preservatory door, and joined the procession from there, after claiming to have battled skulls in the Preservatory.\n* The party arrived at the crime scene: Invictus's \"Hall of Victory,\" the hallway on the 2nd floor leading to the library. The victim was Dominic Tremere, still wearing his Periapt of Health. His heart was cut out in an apparently hasty fashion, with a supernaturally sharp knife. There was surprisingly little blood.\n* The southern door was slightly ajar. The party investigated the room beyond, and found it to be a torture chamber. On the south side, rather than a wall, there was a pit, which was full of a writhing mass of zombies, 15 feet down. Ghensh flew around under the torture chamber, above the zombie, just out of their clutches, searching for clues, but did not find much.\n* The door to the north led to the library.\n* Investigating the body itself, it was clear to the investigators that the scene must have been cleaned up somehow.\n* The pirate returned from outside. The party heard the front door slam, and him tromp up the stairs. His arms were scratched up, from\u2014he claimed\u2014wrestling a tree into submission so that he could shit on it.\n* Callie connected the dots of Alex Orbach being the one who stole the Necronomicon. She believed that whoever had done that is the same person who stole her family heirloom. She confronted Orbach demanding that he empty his pockets. When pressured by everyone else, he reluctantly produced magic chalk of his own design which was \"quantum linked.\"\n  * Orbach expressed scorn that he was kicked out of the wizard college, due to his invention being \"too dangerous.\" It somehow harnesses the Flux to quantumly link objects.\n  * He did not, however, produce the Puzzlebox.\n* Callie cast speak with dead on the corpse.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!\n\nBut they did have a long rest, so they are refreshed.\n\n[Callie](../dossiers/callie), [Bec](../dossiers/bec), and [Freki](../dossiers/freki) realize the mushrooms aren't real&mdash;just psychic residue from the attack in the [Feywild](../locales/feywild).\n\n[Sartus](../dossiers/sartus-morningdew) and Bec dispel [Oz](../dossiers/oz) and [Cal](../dossiers/cal)'s effects. Oz is convinced the mushrooms were mentally real, and he has some psychic damage. Cal is just fatigued.\n\nCallie heals Oz with *cure wounds* at level 2 for 10 HP restoration. But she takes 5 damage from a weird feeling of being STABBED IN THE SOUL BY PURE DEATH AND EVIL.\n\nBec thinks the mushroom face woman is some legendary creature... not a fey creature... but she can't put her finger on it. Neither can Callie.\n\nThe party realizes that outside of their magical protective hut, real (presumably evil) mushrooms have overgrown everything&mdash;even including the hut's walls and ceiling. It's a good thing the tiny hut has a floor too, or who knows what would have happened to the party while they slept!\n\nThe agents spend some time trying to decide how to proceed without getting near the mushrooms, which seem to be emitting some kind of highly poisonous spores. They clear away the mushrooms on the hut's roof, shoot a grappling arrow up to the forest canopy above them, and proceed to climb and/or float their way up into the treetops, safe from the carpet of mushroom death.\n\nSurveying the area around them, while discussing how to proceed from there, Freki's ravens report that someone is closing in on their position. After a short while, a tiny mushroom man riding a poodle moth comes into view!\n\n[![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/88/d7/62/88d76251487db1e123294759ca0ac34e.jpg){:style=\"width:200px\"}](../dossiers/enoki) [![](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/a4/bd/fe/a4bdfef059791096661ca1599e3bc284.jpg){:style=\"width:163px\"}](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/162340761559739851/)\n\nAfter being berated by the creature for riling up the mushrooms, the agents try to explain the situation. [Vondal](../dossiers/vondal) is on the same wavelength with the mushroom druid, who they learn is named [Enoki](../dossiers/enoki), and his moth companion is Cornelius. Enoki and Cornelius fly down to the center of the mushroom field, and the cranky little man begins shouting at the mushrooms and bludgeoning them with his staff, which causes them to recede one by one. After a little while, the agents complain that this approach is going to take forever, and the group arrives at a solution: Enoki can lead a ritual to calm all the mushrooms at once, with the help of the SPI agents.\n\nCallie, Bec, Vondal, and Sartus work to aid Enoki. Sartus continues to seem strangely ill at ease in this natural setting, and he isn't too helpful... but the others are. \n\nAs the ritual nears completion, Cal receives a sending from [Tybalt](../dossiers/tybalt):\n\n* **Tybalt:** We found the [Book](../relics/necronomicon) on the forest floor. Was this your doing? The [Tree](../relics/yggdrasil)'s getting worse. The [queen](../dossiers/ambriel-estanesse) is deathly ill. What do you know?\n* **Cal:** Book not us. Tree has passages bored in. Queen infected by [mushroom woman](../dossiers/zuggtmoy). Freki accidentally decapitated Queen in Feywild. Ritualing with Enoki now. Please advise.\n\nTybalt sends to Cal again:\n\n* **Tybalt:** [Warforged](../relics/warforged) searching area near Book. I will gather more intel and get back to you when I know more. More urgency now. Keep me apprised.\n\nJust as Cal receives this message, the ritual is complete; Enoki exhales an enormous sigh of relief as a massive number of spores shoot from his cap, which cover everything and send all the mushrooms away. \"They won't act up again for a while. I need a nap...\" and he collapses.\n\n* **Cal:** Group casting with Enoki. Will explore passages afterward. Will update with pertinent information. SO MANY SPORES! Mushroom problem resolved.\n\n*GM's note: How and why did Enoki find the SPI agents where he did? Because that's where the trail of mycelial corruption led: to ground zero. He didn't bother explaining this, of course...*\n\nThe agents let Enoki sleep it off while they discuss the situation. They debate whether to return to the surface to meet up with Tybalt and the Warforged, but ultimately decide to continue on their journey to rescue the Fruit of Life from the Tree before it falls victim to the Book's dark magic.\n\nThe agents wake up Enoki and learn that he is familiar with the Fruit of Life, and claims to know where it is. The way he speaks, the party starts to think Enoki might be *really* old&mdash;maybe thousands of years old. Vondal sweet-talks Enoki into guiding them to the Fruit.\n\nThey follow Enoki for several hours. With Freki's survival skills and everyone's vigilance, they are able to proceed up the Tree without any major incidents.\n\nUntil...\n\nThey hear a buzzing sound in the distance. It grows increasinly loud, and after a few minutes a small swarm of locusts comes into view. It seems to be heading for an area just ahead of the party. They reorient themselves into a defensive position as the locusts keep moving, settle into the trunk 50 feet in front of the party, and coelesce into a [bipedal](../glossary#bipedal) shape.\n\nThe being speaks in a droning mass of sound: \"We are [Eixam](../dossiers/eixam) (ee-SHAHM), and we have come to help.\"\n", "id": "events/case-12e06"}, {"title": "[14e01] The Hills Have Malachais", "description": "TODO", "datestamp": "50-06-03/01", "when": "AC50 Vis 03", "session-number": 63, "session-date": "2023-07-29", "session-event": "https://www.facebook.com/events/285891037420798/", "body": "Over the next few days, [Mallory](../dossiers/mallory) (the real one!) and [Cassandra](../dossiers/cassandra) work to get the SPI HQ back into shape.\n\n* All field agents are called back to base for an all-staff meeting on Woodsday, Vis 03. This includes:\n\n  - [Rain](../dossiers/rain)\n  - [Squeaks McKraken](../dossiers/squeaks-mckraken)\n  - [Lawrence Feathersworth](../dossiers/lawrence-feathersworth)\n  - [Victor Rocksmith](../dossiers/victor-rocksmith)\n\n* Meanwhile, our SPI agent heroes have two days off: Vis 01 and Vis 02. Or they can help rebuild HQ.\n\nSome notable things relating our heroes:\n\n- [Cal](../dossiers/cal) feels something has changed about the Arkenstab. He feels it pulsing with more power than ever, but he also feels a shock of momentary cold every time he grasps it. Cold like vengeance.\n- [Bec](../dossiers/bec)'s father [Letharil Galere](../dossiers/letharil-galere) stops by the SPI. To thank her again. He entrusts her with [Sartus](../dossiers/sartus-morningdew)'s spellbooks.\n- [Freki](../dossiers/freki) has time to craft more special arrows.\n- [Oz](../dossiers/oz)'s contacts confirm that they sent him the monkey statue. Signed, sealed, and delivered to SPI administrator Cassandra.\n- [Callie](../dossiers/callie) has a clairvoyant episode.\n\nAt the all-staff meeting: various agents share information about current events:\n\n- In the absence of leadership, McKraken, Feathersworth, and Rocksmith have started to establish SPI outputs in three of the nations: Squeaks under the Mountain, Featherworth in Reena'seere. Rocksmith in Trell.\n\n- Cassandra remembers what happened to her: she and Mallory ([Eeoram](../dossiers/eeoram-sufur), really) were back at the base, trying to deal with [the Breach](the-breach), when they were ambushed by the [Malosi](../orgs/malosi). Before she could react, she was slain by [Andalla](../dossiers/andalla) the dragon shaman. Cassandra felt Andalla pulling at her spirit, trying to consume her, but she managed to flee into the nearby monkey statue, which she sensed could house souls. But once inside, she realized the soul of a monkey was already within, and they began to comingle. Cassandra remembers being inside the statue, her consciousness fading, but striving with all her will to drive the intruders as far away as she could. She doesn't know what happened to Eeoram, but she remembers him being there with her right before the ambush...\n\n- Squeaks McKraken has been working on a case in the dwarven lands:\n  - Dwarves aren't fighting goblins anymore because goblins stopped coming.\n  - When dwarves investigated, they found karach had spread up from the tunnel depths: a \"super bloom\" of karach!\n  - The karach is unstable, and Flux oozes in various places. Squeaks was unable to delve deeper on his own, but he was able to connect the source to the old SPI HQ, behind the sealed off stone wall.\n\n- Lawrence Feathersworth has been in contact with [Arallu](../locales/arallu) about an incident that occurred in [Sepulchralis](../locales/sepulchralis), the underground Arallan necropolis.While agents of Arallu are the ones who contacted him asking for the SPI's help, he has not yet been successful in arranging passage to Arallu to actually investigate what happened. But he knows some details of the incident:\n  - [Evershroud Manor](../locales/evershroud-manor), the primary residence of [Timor Invictus](../dossiers/timor-invictus), suddenly exploded with positive energy on Rixa 25. It is believed that Invictus was inside at the time, and he has not been heard from since.\n  - The undead sent in some living mortals to investigate, but none returned.\n  - The undead themselves cannot enter, for fearing of being quickly destroyed by the positive energy suffusing the place.\n\n- Victor Rocksmith has also been in diplomacy mode:\n  - He has spoken with agents of [Saint Benedor](../dossiers/benedor), who wants the SPI to ensure that an unnatural hurricane from Trell reaches Oasis, to rejuvenate the land, and insists that the SPI owes a debt to his nation for their actions regarding the Cornucopia.\n  - But the dragons of Skyrealm have pledged to unravel the hurricane using air countermagic, and have forbidden the SPI from interfering. It is a brewing international incident.\n  - Rocksmith is not sure what to do, but he was able to trace the origin of the hurricane back to a magical lighthouse on the shores of Trell...\n\n- Rain has been chilling at Vondal's house in Vondal's bathrobes. :-D\n\nFeathersworth has arranged for the Arallan representatives to meet at the SPI outpost in Reena'seere.\n\nMallory approves Cal & company's request to join Feathersworth for the Arallu meeting. But he warns them that that there is a very delicate balance of power in Arallu, and that the actions the agents take could disrupt that balance and lead to world instability.\n\n----------------------\n\n## Callie's Journal\n\nWe have some time off! We need to be back for the all-staff meeting on Woodsday the 3rd.\n\nMallory asks Callie and Bec to help repair the ol' HQ, which is pretty trashed.\n\nBec goes to see the elves and is presented with the spellbooks of Sartus Morningdew. They think that if anyone can use his books to the best effect, it's Bec. Aww!\n\nOz decides to go to \"Gnome Vegas\" to cheat at the casinos. He succeeds! But then Leopold shows up and says \"We've been looking for you!\" Oz tips the dealer 10% of his winnings and says to always remember the name of Freki the werewolf!\n\nCal hangs out at HQ to fix up the training room. He also talks to Mallory and spars with Cassandra (who is boosting her AC with magic). She has some cool magic that makes people not want to hit her. She also tells him his sword synergizes with divine casting. Neat!\n\nCallie goes back to see Gavin at the Emporium. She asks whether he has anything that can help repair HQ. Then, holding a bottle of glue that can stick anything to anything (Sovreign Glue) and a Cube of Mending, she has a vision of a door behind which is the promise of infinite, forbidden knowledge. AND a secret that only Callie can know. She could use the items to seal the door forever OR go in there, get the secrets, and THEN seal it! But before she can make a decision, the vision ends. Gavin asks if she saw tomorrow's lottery numbers and suggests that she come back sometime when she doesn't need anything, just to see him. Aww!\n\n### All-Staff Meeting\n\nRain the Owlbear, Cassandra, Mallory, Squeaks McKraken, Victor Rocksmith, and Lawrence Feathersworth are all there.\n\nOz comes in late, when we're recapping the World Tree events.\n\nMallory congratulates us on saving the World Tree and giving the Necronomicon to the elves. Although we did piss off the RUP by stealing their artifact.\n\nSqueaks McKraken opened an outpost under the mountain, not the same one as the old, sealed off outpost. The dwarves refused to reopen that one because there's a flux leak down there. Squeaks thinks the leak originated in the old SPI outpost and is slowly spreading karach.\n\nVictor Rocksmith set up an outpost in Trell, his homeland. St. Benedor has had a vision that a hurricane will come and rejuvenate the desert that we destroyed by stealing their cornucopia. Unfortunately, the dragons of Zephyr plan to stop the hurricane to prevent it from damaging the Sky Realm. Victor investigated the origin of the hurricane and found it emerged from one of the Trell magic lighthouses. They absorb storm energy, but are not supposed to let any out.\n\nLawrence Feathersworth opened his outpost in his hometown, Reena'seere, a half-elven city that Bec is also from. Some reps from Arallu came out to see him. He arranged a meeting with them for tomorrow over lunch to hear more about their request. Basically, a manor belonging to one of their leaders has begun radiating positive energy and they can't enter it. They need someone living to investigate it.\n\nBec is interested in Cassandra's lack of shadow. Weird! Cassandra suggests letting the monkey out. The monkey nuzzles Oz, then hops over to Cassandra. The monkey has two shadows!! One of them is Cassandra's shadow. The monkey barks at the shadow and poofs back into the statue.\n\nAfter the meeting ends, Freki sniffs around to grab any DNA in case he needs to find these people later. He doesn't get any from Mallory or Rain, but he does get a hair from each of the others.\n\nMallory warns us that the balance of power in Arallu needs to stay balanced. If any of the three factions gains too much power, it could be a disaster.\n\n### Reena'seere\n\nFeathersworth tells us that he has no money (on account of being a statue for centuries), but he has repurposed a B&B for his outpost. He apologizes for the dinginess of the place, and makes us tea! It's slightly chilly, so he starts a fire in the fireplace. He's great!\n\nAt noon, three figures teleport inside: [Grim Tanzerin](../dossiers/grim-tanzerin), [Lestache de Lyarcourt](../dossiers/lestache-de-lyarcourt), and [Malachai Hawthorne](../dossiers/malachai-hawthorne). Bec sees that Lestache has some magical items, Grim's chain is magical, and Malachai is filled with transmutation magic.\n\nLyarcourt introduces Hawthorne, but Bec has to ask about Grim. Lyarcourt says he's \"nobody, protection.\" Lyarcourt totally has some tea. Cal thinks maybe he has heard of Malachai. Malachai is one of Invictus's top lieutenants. Supposedly Malachai ripped out his own heart and replaced it with a spirit trapped in a gemstone to avoid dying of old age. He isn't exactly undead himself, but this is obviously some real dark magic. Cal thinks Lestache is some kind of vampire nobility.\n\nMalachai was apparently a witness to whatever happened at Evershroud Manor. He says there was an explosion of energy and he barely teleported out in time. He was near the Chamber of Whispers. He thinks the energy came from inside the Chamber. Invictus may or may not have been in the Chamber. \n\nLestache says that, according to his sources, the explosion source was the basement. He's going to share everything he knows as a courtesy, so we don't all die. Such a sweetie. It's hard to read whether he's lying or just oily.\n\nMalachai seems to have a deep desire to direct us to the Chamber of Whispers, though why is unclear. Additionally, Callie senses that he is anticipating us going there, so something will happen.\n\nLestache and Malachai are very not agreed on where they think we should go.\n\nThe Triumvirate (https://ctrue.name/equilibrium/creatures/undead):\n- Timor Invictus is the archmage, he's the one who's missing.\n- [The Brucolac](../dossiers/cronus) is the head of the vampires. Lestache serves him.\n- [Janus Ilaris](../dossiers/janus-ilaris) is a spirit and head of...spirits? We've seen him around, possessing people at times.\n\nMalachai describes the manor. There's a study where Invictus does divination, some bedrooms, an art gallery. In the gallery is door to the whispering chamber. Malachai says the basement doesn't matter. Lestache wants to talk about the basement! That's where the lich has his crypts and builds his undead horde. Lestache thinks Invictus lost control of one of his magical artifacts and that's what caused the explosion. We'll see about that!\n\n### Evershroud Manor\n\nWe are teleported by Malachai. It's a normal teleport, but we won't be able to get back on our own (the spell is too high level for us). When we get there, we feel great from the radiant energy, but the undeads aren't comfy.\n\nMalachai hands Feathersworth a bag and starts casting a spell. Bec realizes that the spell is to turn Feathersworth into a puppet! She tells us that the spell is dangerous and Lestache tries to stop Malachai but Malachai doesn't stop casting.\n\nCal whips out his sword to slice off Malachai's arm, but before he can move, Oz stabs Malachai in the gut with the hornblade. Malachai stops casting, but doesn't seem all that upset? Then suddenly a creature kind of emerges from Malachai and then his face reassembles. Gross! \n\nThe creature claims that he saw what he saw and is definitely not lying. Bec and Cal are 100% sure he is lying. He didn't see anything, that eyeless bastard! He tries to run away, seeing that we are now hostile, but Freki nabs him with a grapple arrow and Cal incinerates him with his sword.\n\nLestache says he'll investigate what that whole thing was about. Bec asks him directly if he knows about [totenmaskes](../creatures/totenmaskes), but he says he doesn't. Callie thinks he's probably telling the truth, but it's hard to say.\n\nAs we approach the entrance, we see that there's no sky. It appears to be inside an enormous dome or maybe underground? This is similar to the dwarf caves, but grander. It looks like outside, but dimmer.\n\n[![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/18/96/c3/1896c310050a7c76c10fd741319fb546.jpg)](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/guild-trash-concept-inspo--9218374228663639/)\n\nRays of light are shooting out the windows.

They decide to store the treasure chests inside one of the treasures, a magical hole that is 10 feet deep and can be folded up.\n\nWhen they get to the elven dwelling in the tree, everybody eats dinner and then they all go to bed. We are soooo tired!\n\nBec is woken up right at the beginning of her rest by ~~some bastard~~[Tybalt](../dossiers/tybalt). She comes out of her room and discovers the *tree-melded*. These elves are being absorbed by the tree, supplying their own life force to keep the tree alive. Her father is one of them! Every day one of these tree-melded gives up their own life so the tree doesn't die. So far it hasn't been him, but it could be any time.\n\nBec's father says that it is a great honor to be joined with the tree, and it would have been a dishonor if he refused, so he did it and didn't tell his family in case seeing them broke his resolve. He points out that [Sartus](../dossiers/sartus-morningdew)'s plan will end up killing the tree, and the tree-melded along with it. The tree will be reborn, but there would be destruction in the meantime. This is why the Queen and most of the elves favor stopping the Druid and taking the Necronomicon back.\n\nBec asks Tybalt what his patron is doing to help this situation. Tybalt says he can't speak to his patron's intentions, he can only carry out his patron's will. Tybalt offers to use his patron's leverage to get the party a meeting with the Queen if that's what we want. He can't go with us if we decide to join the hunt for the Druid, but he will try to help however he can.\n\nDuring their goodbyes, Bec's father asks her not to consider his life as part of her decision. He also says he'll help if he can. And if he lives through whatever happens next, then he hopes they'll meet again. Then he says that the Queen is not of sound mind and sometimes what she says can't be trusted. But sometimes she has incredible insight, so, try to tell which is which.\n\nThe next morning, Sartus is true to his word and escorts the party to the treasure vault, where they are able to trade some of their merfolk treasures for elven items of magic power to help them on their mission. Available treasures include:\n\nItem | Negotiated price (gp) | Rarity\n-- | -- | --\n[Amulet of Health](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4568-amulet-of-health) | 8000 | Rare\n[Glamoured Studded Leather](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4645-glamoured-studded-leather) | 2000 | Rare (Major)\n[Boots of Speed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4589-boots-of-speed) | 4000 | Rare\n[Boots of Elvenkind](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4587-boots-of-elvenkind) | 2500 | Uncommon\n[Bracers of Archery](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4593-bracers-of-archery) | 1500 | Uncommon\n\nThe treasure vault also has an [Ioun Stone of Mastery](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4938-ioun-stone-of-mastery), which is a Legendary (Major) treasure that Oz considers bargaining for, but then decides it would be better to come back later to steal it instead.\n\nGeared up, the agents set out to begin scaling the Tree in search of the legendary Acorn of Life.\n", "id": "events/case-12e02"}, {"title": "[15e03] The Hunt", "description": "TODO", "datestamp": "50-06-04/03", "when": "AC50 Vis 04", "session-number": 71, "session-date": "2024-03-30", "session-event": "https://www.facebook.com/events/3518913611754028/", "body": "## Callie's Journal\n\n*GM's note: NOT FINALIZED*\n\nI know that the sword that the halfling took will make people paranoid and then turn into a devil. The sword may have influenced her to take it. Oz noted that Orlock used tongs to put it into the cage. Oz tries to tell her that the sword is evil, but she just clings to it harder and says he can take it out of her cold dead hands. It's sad when people get bitter, and cling to weapons or religion or antipathy toward people who aren't like them...or people who are exactly like them....\n\nWe decide to throw in the Candles of the Deep as Clan SPI's offering. Bec and I make a huge show, based on the ritual elements of how the vampires put in their items. We demonstrate how they work underwater using Oz's vase of endless water. It's a pretty good show, if I do say so myself! Freki pretends to freak out at the sight of the fire, which attracts the vampires' attention. Meanwhile, Oz sneaks over and gives Sophie my Clamulet, which should help her against undead. She already has something around her neck, which Oz recognizes as an amulet of Tiamat (since he just saw that symbol in Bilbo's house).\n\nWith the offering complete, Lestache announces that the hunt can begin. Orlok, since their clan is not participating, guards the valuables. Lestache also lets us know that we can't pull any funny business like hanging around and waiting for Sophie.\n\nThey open the cage so the \"fox\" can run. Dragon wings pop out of Sophie's back and she flies away! Lestache seems surprised, although it's hard to tell with him how much is part of the show. But then he suggests that they start hunting right away instead of giving her a head start, so it seems more clear now.\n\nOz tries to challenge the vamps' courage on the basis that they shouldn't need to cheat to catch a halfling, even with wings. Some of the vampires are convinced, but some are unimpressed and just head out.\n\nFreki keeps sniffing around. Seems like it's time to go.\n\nEnoch bids us good luck and then turns into some kind of winged demon and flies away. What a man! I hope we don't have to fight him!\n\nWe head out and Freki tries to track Sophie. He smells her scent going in 7 different directions, but he knows that this is a magical illusion and he knows which one is the right one. Go, Freki, go!\n\nWe continue on and enter an area that feels wrong. It is unhallowed ground, which is the opposite of hallowed ground and resists the living. Ugh, I can't wait to get out of here. Bec wants to pull out her Mace of Disruption for the light. She puts a cloth over it so it's not like a beacon in the darkness. There are some skeletons in the distance, but they don't seem to have seen us. They have no eyes, how could they?\n\nWe end up kind of sandwiched between the Brujah and Enoch, oh no. In order to follow the trail, we need to follow Enoch while avoiding the Brujah. I channel Avandra and send a duplicate of myself shrieking down the alley to distract the Brujah while we go ahead.\n\nWe feel a horrible sense of oppression and surveillance. It's the Malachimera, urggghhhh. We decide not to attack it because that would draw unwanted attention. Bec wants to make us a tiny hut on the flying carpet to keep us safe in case it attacks. She does, so we have a silent-running covered wagon now!\n\nAs we tool around on the carpet, following Freki's supersniffer, we suddenly notice that the Malachimera is ON TOP OF THE DOME TRYING TO SEE IN AND I WILL NEVER SLEEP AGAIN. Nevertheless, this is the life I chose, so we carry on.\n\nAt a fork in the road, Freki isn't sure which way Sophie went. We know which way Enoch went, so we decide to go the opposite direction and bank on him being wrong. Meanwhile, we're just flying around with this Malachimera on top of our tiny hut because we don't seem to have any better options. Then the thing starts banging on the top of the dome. Dammit! It can't get in here, but it's making a lot of noise!\n\nOz decides to make the carpet do a barrel roll, which probably seemed like a good idea at the time but feels less good to me and Bec, who are rattling around like the last bean in the can. Oz and Freki each manage to grab one of us, wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeew. Unfortunately, the Malachimera is still on top of the dome.\n\nBut then, it shoots some kind of a fireball at Malak and disintegrates their cloud of bats. Malak is set on fire and if not destroyed, is at least distracted. I'm going to write ha-ha because I can't laugh while we're trying to be stealthy. \n\nCalderon the Cold and Lestache are facing off against each other. Heh heh.\n\nMalachimera is banging on the dome again. Will anyone rid us of this turbulent abomination? We decide to use melee attacks against it, which we can do through the dome. I Bless Freki, Oz, and Bec. The dome kind of mutes the effect of Freki's arrows. Also, things have a way of passing through this thing. However, their combined attacks dislodge it and it ends up under the carpet. Not sure I like that any better, TBH.\n\nWe can see Lestache and Calderon ahead of us, so we try to take the carpet over their heads. Lestache spots us, but luckily they're both distracted by the arrival of Malachimera! Go, creature, go! You my friend.\n\nI drop Bless for the time being so I can give Guidance to Freki. We need to know where we're going. Behind us, Lestache calls, \"You idiot! They're getting away!\" But then he's on fire and we are sailing away, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. It's almost like treating living creatures as playthings has some kind of consequences? Well, Malachai wasn't alive, but it's the principle of the thing.\n\nWe almost fly into a bunch of mummies that were camoflaged against these ruins, yikes! We're surrounded by all kinds of weird undead things, on unhallowed ground, and just overall this is one of the worst situations I've ever been in, including when I was stranded at the bottom of the ocean. I have to pick who to Guide, and I choose Oz this time because I feel like we need to stay hidden. I'm not scared, you're scared!\n\nFreki thinks we're close and another push could get us to Sophie. For the next choice, I decide to push through my fear and Guide Freki for this one, in hopes that we can get to her fast.\n\nAround the next corner, we see a clearing with some buildings. We've lost track of the vampires, but unfortunately that doesn't mean they're gone. Enoch is above us. He says \"Greetings\" as if he can see us, although he shouldn't be able to.\n\nWe can see Sophie across the way. She yells, \"I'm the one you want, you sons of bitches!\" I like her. I hope we can have a drink together someday. Oz notices a mark on a doorway that looks like it may be a thieves cant symbol. He doesn't recognize it, unfortunately, so it's hard to say if it's a good sign or a bad sign.\n\nEnoch is distracted by Sophie (or possibly \"Sophie\") and flies away from us. But then, like an idiot, Oz yells out, \"Hey asshole, your wings look like shit!\" It's a use of Panache we've never seen before! This will grab Enoch's attention...obviously...but also gives him disadvantage against anybody but Oz. Meanwhile, the Gangrel go after Sophie.\n\nFreki sends Hugin and Munin over to the mystery building to find out if Sophie is in there and let her know that we're on her side if she is. Enoch comes back around the corner as a hellbeast and calls Oz out. Oz kisses his monkey and jumps out of the hut, ready to rumble!\n", "id": "events/case-15e03"}, {"title": "[09e04] Time Travel Shenanigans", "description": "Stayed a night at HQ, during which time Mary Reed was caught stealing and unmasked as Seirye Qin.

He likes the weird magical plant! Vondal casts Read Thoughts and kind of talks to the desk. Desky tries to get the party to open up its drawers and take what's inside. Inside the drawer is a number of helpful alchemical objects. Vondal immediately becomes best buds with Desky, but their conversation takes a strange(r) turn and the party leaves.

Be at the 4th Circle of Estanesse at twilight on Evensday. Rest assured that all manner of precautions are being taken to protect all involved parties. Yours sincerely, P. Stormcloud, MAI, MHA.\"\n  * Callie and Bec knew the name P. Stormcloud: she is a historian, author of \"The Aecus Concord and the War of Countless Deaths,\" the definitive history of the events leading up to the cataclysm and reformation 50 years ago.\n  * MAI = Master of Arcane Invocations; MHA = Master of the Historical Arts.\n\n* Mallory briefed the team on known artifacts likely to be on par with the lamp. These objects might (or might not) be part of this auction. The artifacts in the file include: 1) the Necronomicon, 2) the Arkenstone; 3) the Cornucopia of Life; 4) Yggdrasil, the World Tree; and 5) the Lamp of Seeming. After hearing about the artifacts, it occurred to Bec that each one seemed to be aligned with a different divine domain! See [Items of Interest](case-07#items-of-interest) from the case 07 file for details.\n\n* In the 24 hours before the meeting time, Bec, Callie, and Vondal investigated possible artifacts for the remaining domains:\n  * Knowledge: Callie had a hunch about what it might be! But she did not share.\n  * Tempest: Callie summoned Belifax so that she and Bec could ask him about Melora, the goddess of the sea who the citizens of Trell are forbidden to worship. When they dropped her name, Belifax whispered the legend: Melora lives in the eye of the Relentless Hurricane, at the helm of a mighty vessel which she built using her own two hands. Many in Trell do not believe it, and in fact, Melora worship is sometimes punished by sending the offenders into the hurricane. Belifax then offered them some freshly baked blood cookies.\n  * War: No ideas yet!\n* Meanwhile, Freki scouted out the 4th Circle of Estanesse, and found it looks like this: He staked out the place for 24 hours. As the time of the meeting neared, several colorful characters emerged\u2014see [Persons of Interest](case-07#persons-of-interest) from the case 07 file for details.\n* Timor Invictus appeared at the circle, and demanded everyone produce their invitations.\n", "id": "events/case-07e01"}, {"title": "The Dawn of Time", "datestamp": "00-00-00", "when": "The Beginning", "body": "The world was born from [primordial](../creatures/primordials) power.\n", "id": "events/dawn-of-time"}, {"title": "[08e03] Blood & Fire & Landsharks", "description": "Fought the circus monsters; escaped by climbing the Vondalstalk", "datestamp": "50-04-19/03", "when": "AC50 Cudo 19", "session-number": 26, "session-date": "2018-05-04", "session-event": "https://www.facebook.com/events/136627437057099/", "body": "* Fire was all over, and several people fell into the pit down the rockslide of rubble.\n* [Vondal](../dossiers/vondal) tried to use wild magic to mitigate the situation, but managed to turn himself and Ozborn into potted plants.\n* [Meroe](../dossiers/meroe) tried to kill everyone with magic.

On the way to the castle to question Rubinia Elka, Vondal seemed pensive and distracted. He made a flimsy excuse that he needed to buy some fruit from a nearby stand, told everyone to proceed without him, and said that he would catch up later.\n2. The party talked to Rubinia Elka. Elka shared that Zanic Corbinic was expelled on suspicion of organizing a terrorist network. She warned them that he is extremely unstable and dangerous, stopping at nothing to achieve his radical goals.\n3. They told Elka known details of the crime. She shared her copy of Thaumaturgical Herbology, and together discovered that the harpy's tears could have been used to mix a poison known as midnight tears, \"the only poison strong enough to kill a dwarf.\"\n4. After some consideration, Elka told them that ancient legends tell of necromancers who could animate parts of a body, including a hand. Callisto recognizes this legend as that of the crawling claw, a rare form of undead. Other small forms of undead such as flaming skulls would still be too large to fit under the door.\n5. The party returned to Aldrimor Keep. They talked to Bruck, who told Sima alone that Stave was off on a midnight liaison with his \"friend,\" and Bruck may or may not have fallen asleep on guard duty. He also said that Hollerd is the one who brought Gurin his evening meal in his room, and that they argued loudly.\n6. Vondal reappeared at the manor with a manilla envelope with a top secret SPI file which he claimed was somehow \"not destroyed in the fire\"\u2014and for which he claimed he shouldn't have clearance. Inside was a document about an organization called Esprit Repose: a secret cabal of necromancers known to engage in sacrifice of living creatures, but whose threat rating is unknown. Five people have \"potential affiliation\" based on \"unreliable testimony,\" including Bronce Aldrimor, Zanic Corbinic and Rubinia Elka. The cabal is rumored to possess \"Vecna's Lore,\" which the party believes might be an amulet (the amulet?) that connects its bearer to Vecna, imbuing secret forbidden knowledge.\n7. The party (sans Vondal) went to the Brandywhistle in the Flintlock district. It's a small tavern, less than a dozen tables, plus a small bar. The locals there are the rougher sort, with weapons and hide armor. Sima tells the barkeep that they, the SPI, are seeking information leading to the apprehension of necromancers who have recently committed horrid and illicit acts under the Mountain. And the SPI has reason to believe the Zanic Corbinic may possess useful information to help quell this foul tide. The barkeep was upset to learn that Larsa Wrathborn is the one who tipped off the authorities about the Brandywhistle. But she trusts Sima when she hears that the SPI has no interest in dwarven politics. She says she will \"see what she can do\" about arranging a meeting with Zanic, if the party will wait outside. The party goes around back to tell Callisto the good news\u2014and suddenly the back door bursts open and a hooded figure tears down the tunnel\u2026!\n", "id": "events/case-03e03"}, {"title": "[15e04] Turnabout Combat", "description": "TODO", "datestamp": "50-06-04/04", "when": "AC50 Vis 04", "session-number": 72, "session-date": "2024-04-13", "session-event": "https://www.facebook.com/events/385622380948065/", "body": "## Callie's Journal\n\n*GM's note: NOT FINALIZED*\n\nWe're all Blessed, at least as far as we can be in this awful place. We also have 7 temporary HP due to the incredible banquet. I really have to learn that spell.\n\nFreki's bird friends have spotted something. They dive down and...um...poof out of existence???\n\nOz faces off with Enoch. Aim away from the face, Oz! He stabs Enoch a lot and then runs away, drawing Enoch's attention away from the building. It's a run-by stabbing!\n\nBec casts Detect Magic on the building. It seems to be shielded with abjuration magic of some kind, similar to Bilbo's house. Anyway, Bec is going to stay here in the tiny hut so we can stay protected.\n\nFreki is frekied out by the disappearance of the birds, so he starts getting hairy and decides to jump through a window after them. CRASH! Subtle, wolfie. [Inside, Freki is deafened. He sees three Sophies. Two are looking menacing and battle-ready, and a third is hiding as well as she can. He tells her not to worry, we're on her side. Unfortunately, if she says anything back, he can't hear her. D'oh! The three of them start casting a spell and the broken window mends itself.]\n\nI decide, in a split second, to take control of the flying carpet and hide it (sort of) behind one of the buildings in the square. I don't want to draw attention to the building, which I'm guessing is where Sophie is hidden. And/or where Freki just died, hard to say. Look, I'm not saying that factored into my decision!\n\nEnoch looks like he's about to fly, but then teleports instead. Looks like Oz hit a nerve with that \"your wings are shit\" line. Enoch smacks him from behind and rakes him with a claw. Oz dodges and doesn't take the full hit, but Enoch grapples him and tries to bite him. Oz wriggles away from the bite and Enoch stomps him with a fiery claw. Then he spins around and blasts Oz with a fire hand. That spin was really cool, but Oz didn't have much trouble dodging it.\n\n[Cal is aware that Enoch has a lot of resistances that normal undeads do not. He is also calm and may have many other hidden talents, but he also has the standard vampire weaknesses, like running water, sunlight, stakes, holy symbols, etc.).] \n\nCal focuses his ire on Enoch and runs toward him. The fire that Enoch summoned gets all sparkly and then Vondal appears out of the flames, behind Oz. The last thing Vondal remembers is the introduction to the hunt. Suddenly he's in this ruined town square and the halflings are fighting a vampire. OK! He summons a giant horizontal wall of light. Enoch flinches and his wounds stop healing. Ooh, good one, Vondal!\n\nOz attacks again and Enoch still seems calm, although he's bleeding now.\n\nBec elbows me aside -- politely, as she does -- and takes the carpet over to the building where we think Sophie is. We're going to go in together.\n\nOz's monkey flies into the light, briefly casting a shadow outside the wall of light. The shadow it casts...does not look like a monkey. It has no wings. It is halfling shaped, like the ghost Oz has described. Weird!\n\nFreki leaps at Sophie to bite her, thus \"drawing first blood\" to win the hunt. He gives her a little nibble. She tastes like halfling, with a little bit of infernal hellfire contamination. He grapples her and tries to tell her that she should stop fighting because we've won according to the rules. She wriggles out of his grasp.\n\nThere's a ringing and Orlok's voice says that the hunt is over, as the condition has been met.\n\nSophie frowns at Freki and puts a hand on her wound. She almost looks like she understands, but then the sword takes control and she attacks Freki. \n\nBec and I run into the house. I want to use Calm Emotions, but as I reach for the spell, Avandra puts another, unknown spell in its place. I decide to have faith, faith, faith and cast the spell. Suddenly I'm where Sophie was and Freki is towering over me!\n\nHearing the announcement, Enoch says, \"How unfortunate\" and teleports away. I assume Cal and Oz are disappointed, but I'm happy that Enoch lived another day. I'm only telling you this, journal. Shh!\n\nOz and Cal enter the room and Oz is like, \"Ladies, it'll take me a while but I'm willing to try.\" This may or may not be the reason Sophie is glaring murderously at us. \n\nBec uses a hypnotic gaze on Sophie and she goes kind of slack. Even though her hand is open, the sword doesn't fall out of it. So creepy. Cal smacks the sword out of her hand with a remarkable well-aimed strike. There's a weird tearing noise and Sophie seems to come back to herself. I try to tell her that we won, but she's still focused on the windows, like, you're welcome. Anyway, I can help the Sophielings with mending, but it takes a few minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, Cal picks up the cursed sword with his whip and pauses an uncomfortably long time before throwing it into our portable hole. We should find a volcano to throw that thing in.\n\nWhile we're working on the window, we see the Gangrels coming around the corner. Then more vampires. Is this a casual stroll, or more like a Reservoir Dogs stroll?\n\nSophie hangs up some Tiamat symbols around the building. Oz tries some line on her and she's like OUTTA MY WAY. He looks like he's in love. Me too, maybe.\n\nFreki asks why he was deafened. Sophie tells him that he triggered her defenses by coming in through the window instead of the door. The birds were apparently eaten by Tiamat, oh dear.\n\nElloia comes up to the door all, \"Would you like to open the door?\" Hmmm. I wish I could, but I don't want to.\n\nSophie and Oz try to thieves cant at each other, but they don't understand each other. Sophie calls us all over to the corner farthest from the vampires and we talk quietly. She says we need to track down the Death Tyrant and destroy it. She doesn't know where it is, though. She strolls over to the window and tells the vampires that Vondal's wall of light is going to vaporize them if they don't tell her what she wants to know.\n\nEnoch says they'll tell us what we want to know when the light is gone. Vondal says sure and then shoots him with the wall of light. Enoch turns invisible somehow. He's so cool. Vondal continues to strike at him in the same location. Enoch says, \"You are a fool.\" Vondal tries again, but Enoch is somewhere else now.\n\nOz uses his panache on Elloia and asks her what she knows about the Death Tyrant. She tells him that Enoch knows and probably would have told us if we hadn't attacked him. Then she asks if he wants to be a vampire. She can totally hook him up. She'd also be happy to turn Freki, who would be \"something special.\" She isn't interested in the rest of us. Mean! Anyway, she and Oz promise to meet again and then she takes her clan and leaves. Some down, a lot to go.\n\nI keep feeling like I'm being watched. Is it Avandra...?\n\nOz, Cal, and Vondal run out and start slashing stuff. Eight of them surround Cal, three of them are grappling him. One is a statue thanks to Vondal.\n\nI Channel Divinity to Turn Undead and a number of them drop Cal and make to flee. I summon my spiritual weapon and attack the most raggedy-looking one. It doesn't die, boo.\n\nFreki uses an arrow of tidal force against a vampire. A stream of water trails from it, rising to a tidal wave when it hits the vampire. Kelp rises out of the ground and ensnares them all! They are also vulnerable to the running water, because vampires. Heh heh. Freki still has two of those left, too!\n\nAfter we're done killing or chasing off all the vampires, Goratrix shows up. THAT'S THE CREEP WHO'S BEEN WATCHING ME! He slow claps and thanks us for doing his work for him.

[Oz](../dossiers/oz) sticks his head out the door and tries to get the ghast to go away using deception. The ghast agrees to wait.\n\nOz asks me to use my disguise kit on him, so I start doing makeup. He looks almost not entirely unlike [Bilbo](../dossiers/bilbo) when I'm done. The real Bilbo is tied up and still invisible in his house, left on his bed with the covers rumpled so it looks like he's just a slob. The ropes aren't invisible, though, so this won't stand up to serious scrutiny. How did he *do* that invisibility trick, anyway? That was cool!\n\nWe go outside and the ghasts are suspicious on the basis of smell, but don't call us on it. We all hop on the ol' magic carpet and head to the ball. [Vondal](../dossiers/vondal) somehow has a good mental map of the layout of the city, and also thinks there's a spider-filled plane alarmingly but not immediately nearby. Why did he think we needed to know that?!\n\nWhen we get to the castle, Oz/Bilbo pipes up that the \"good-looking one\" had the audacity to attack him, but we left him tied up back at Bilbo's place. Heh heh heh.\n\nWhen we enter the grand entrance hall, [Lestache](../dossiers/lestache-de-lyarcourt) enters at the other end. He's dressed even fancier than before, including a maquerade-style mask. He has provided food and drink, which we can enjoy in any of the private alcove rooms off the main hall.\n\nOzbo and Vondal have a loud argument about whether Ozbo should be greeting the guests or entertaining us in a side room, so already this plan is off to an excellent start.\n\n\"Our first guest has arrived! It begins!\" announces Lestache.\n\nA woman in a frilly gown leans down and demands Ozbo announce her. He makes an excuse about getting a head injury and begs her pardon, so she tells him her name. He makes a big show out of introducing her but forgets her last name, whoops.\n\nLestache tells her that she's the first to arrive so she has the \"first chance,\" whatever that's supposed to mean. \n\nOzbo asks Lestache if everything is set to go according to plan, and Lestache tells him he'd know better, since he's the one who arranged most of it. Ozbo asks about the \"main event\" and Lestache looks confused and says, \"You mean the hunt?\" There's a twinkle in Lestache's eye and Ozbo fends off some sort of mental incursion. Lestache orders him to get in the alcove and entertain the livvies. He's suspicious and concerned.\n\nOz comes into our room and lets us know that there's a \"hunt\" planned, quarry unknown. Someone else is announcing the guests now. Eavesdropping, we find that Lestache has assigned a woman to the task who isn't entirely pleased to have it. He owes her a favor now. Her name is [Etria LeDuc](../dossiers/etria-leduc), the Shimering Star of [Sepulchralis](../locales/sepulchralis), and she summons an ethereal harp and strums it, giving us all a little frisson of pleasure.\n\nFreki hears someone outside say, \"Bilbo is one of them. Just play along. It will be funny.\"\n\nNow's the time when we can prepare some rituals if we want. Lestache pops in and we have a short discussion where he agrees it's time to introduce us.\n\nThe bell rings again and [Malak](../dossiers/malak-the-mad) the Mad, Mother of Malkavia and Father of Fascination, enters. They wave hello to us. [Bec](../dossiers/bec) is still pretty sore about that time Malak tried to kill us...earlier today. The assorted [vamps](../creatures/vampires) all look at each other. \n\nLestache apologizes on behalf of Malak, who says they didn't try to kill us. Lestache believes there are good people on both sides of this conflict. Maybe it was a misunderstanding! (It was not a misunderstanding.)\n\nAll the vampires fall silent as [Enoch the Wise](../dossiers/enoch-the-wise), Lord of the Inner Council of Seven, enters. Etria plays an even fancier intro theme for him. He suggests we get the party started. Note for future research: can vampires get crunk?\n\nLestache tells us we can introduce ourselves, so we do, with Etria playing a little harp flourish between each of us. The vampires applaud politely. Lestache announces that the living guests are not to be harmed, and that we'll have our own buffet, and then tells everybody to go ahead and make merry until the evening's events start.\n\nEtria summons a banquet for us. Hell yes, wish I could do that!\n\nOzbo notices that [Troile](../dossiers/troile-the-rebel) (who was announced earlier as Troile the Rebel, the Peerless, Champion of Serene Wrath) is not dancing, and in fact they and their retinue have organized themselves in posts around the room. Ozbo pulls Troile aside and Panaches him with a side order of shameless flattery. Ozbo pulls out the vial of [changeling](../creatures/changelings) blood and says, \"I don't know what this is, but it came out of my master when he sustained a wound. I think something horrible may have befallen him!\" Troile thanks him and Ozbo slinks away.\n\nThe effects of the feast include curing us of disease and poison and making us feel generally invigorated. Bec is aware that the spell that created the feast *should* have taken 10 minutes, but only took her 1. Bec is enjoying her entire plate of celery and compliments Etria on her harp skill and the food. Bec and Etria dance, and they seem equally impressed with each other.\n\nOzbo gets into the ruse and figures out that although he is basically livestock, he works for The Master, so he gets what he wants if he plays that card. The power goes straight to his head, but he also uses the opportunity to spy on Troile.\n\n[Freki](../dossiers/freki) is wondering if the band is dead or [halflings](../creatures/halflings). Is anybody alive in this place? There are no ghouls or ghasts, just vampires...and no Lestache. Hmm. Freki catches a glimpse of him disappearing towards the front door in a sketchy way and tries to tail him casually. Some vampires intercept him and strike up a conversation about his [werewolfiness](../creatures/lycans) and what forest he's from. In an attempt to fit in, Freki says the [Selva](../locales/selva)'s [orc](../creatures/orcs) population has been \"civilized,\" but feels gross saying it. Since Freki is detained, he asks [Hugin](../dossiers/hugin) and [Munin](../dossiers/munin) to follow Lestache and spy a little. Meanwhile, he chats with the vamps. They say it's been a while since they had guests, since they usually, you know, eat them.\n\nLestache returns and Freki senses satisfaction, like something went well, and a bouncy anticipation. Freki asks about the vampire he's talking to. This is Orrick of Clan Ventru.\n\nOzbo is watching Troile and Freki is watching Lestache, so they both watch when the two vampires have a quiet chat. Lestache looks mildly annoyed. \n\nBec and Etria are having a nice time talking about magic. Etria asks if she knows a spell that makes people never stop laughing. It's her favorite! Etria is a devoted hedonist. She's sick of having goals. It gets repetitive. She's over 500 years old, and has concluded that nothing really matters. Bec says a benefit of being mortal is that you don't really have time to get bored. Etria smiles and agrees. \"It's cute, really.\"\n\nLestache comes and grabs Bec, telling Etria to have a good time. Etria says, \"I was.\" Hahaha. We all get collected and ushered away.\n\nOnce we're all assembled, Lestache tells us to dispense with the charade and take off the silly Bilbo disguise. He seems rather unconcerned with out intent, but does want to know if we harmed Bilbo. Freki says none of us here did anything to Bilbo. Totally true, as [Cal](../dossiers/cal) (wait... who is Cal...?) is not here. Somehow this all makes sense to us. He offers to answer all our questions.\n\nFreki asks if the vampires could *not* treat the [halfling village](../locales/xaryuvia) like a vegetable garden. Lestache understands his concern, but there's no getting around it. This is just a city of undead monsters, man! Live and let unlive! He does find Oz very amusing, but he couldn't play along after Oz tried the changeling blood thing. I admit that we barely know what Oz is going to do from minute to minute, ourselves.\n\nA gong interrupts us. \"He\" is here, ugh. Lestache asks Oz to introduce him and says a bunch of words, which Oz probably didn't catch, whoops.\n\nOz heads out and tells the guest that Lestache gave him instructions. Is the guest ready to come in? [Goratrix Ceoris](../dossiers/goratrix-ceoris) tells him \"almost\" and starts something that looks like, but is not exactly, spellcasting. He clenches his fist and we feel an ethereal shattering of some kind. \"Now I'm ready,\" he says, and enters.\n\nLestache wearily tells Goratrix he could have just extended an invitation, but Goratrix likes doing it this way. Of course he does.\n\nOz introduces him as \"the hidden, the tiny, the pink man in the boat, Goratrix Clitoris!\" Everybody laughs. Goratrix is mad, as Oz intended, but Lestache is like, \"Obviously I didn't tell him to do that. It was pretty hilarious, tho.\"\n\nGoratrix tries another spell-like incantation, but Lestache stops him from making a big scene. One of Goratrix's entourage, [Meerlinda Descant](../dossiers/meerlinda-descant), introduces herself with the title \"Weaver of Dreams\" as reality appears to shift all around us. She then proceeds to announce another of Goratrix's companions, [Calderon the Cold](../dossiers/calderon-the-cold), Bane of Spiderkind, with an illusion of Calderon destroying spiders. Then she performs three illusions as part of introducing Goratrix. The first is an important-looking room with Goratrix the most important (\"Archmage of the Crispic Clan\"). The second is the whole city, laid out before us (\"Architect of Sepulchris\"). The third is him ordering around a bunch of gargoyles (\"Supreme Commander of Gargoyles\").\n\nLestache is all, \"Do you *have* to do the whole thing *every time*, sheesh!\" He starts calling Goratrix increasingly elaborate names (\"Pompous cockolorum! Conniving snollygoster! You purveyor of falseness and untidy monstrosities!\"). He's getting all lathered up when Troile tells him to settle down.\n\nGoratrix wanders off and Freki proposes getting him out of the way to Lestache. Lestache finds him irritating, but not enough to murder him, as it turns out. \"He thinks he's stronger because he broke into my manor and forced a good announcement, but it means nothing.\" Lestache is not willing to ruin the party just to measure his...dominance...over Goratrix.\n\nFreki asks him whether he's quite sure he's going to like all the surprises tonight. Lestache tells him there will be some kind of gladitorial event where Goratrix will come out on top, and then in the hunt, Lestache will reveal *his* trump card. \"It's all showmanship!\"\n\nFrom my investigations in the past hour or so, I have figured out there are probably at least seven vampire clans, of which I know the names of several: Ventru, Crispic, Brujah, the ones that Malak and Lestache belong to, and two more. Lestache, Troile, and Malak are allies. Etria is part of Lestache's clan, which is probably why she has to defer to him. \n\nWe all head back into the ballroom. Bec goes to find Etria again and chats her up about the harp. Calderon finds Vondal and chats him up about hearing the voice of [Lolth](../dossiers/lolth). He says his clan has worked hard to contain the spiders. Vondal says he can tell they're still close. The tendrils of [the Flux](../locales/flux) continue to grow, and will eventually tear this reality apart. Calderon wants to know how the Flux scarred him. Vondal says using his power is dangerous, plus he's single! Calderon offers him a place with his clan where he can learn to master his power, if Vondal will serve with them to destroy the spiders and bring glory to their clan. \"What kind of glory do you seek?\" Vondal would like to publish another book. Calderon laughs and tells him to think about it.\n\nGoratrix won't approach any of us because we're beneath him. Enoch comes over to talk to me, oh boy! He kisses my hand and invites me to sit down. He wants to know what happened with [Invictus](../dossiers/timor-invictus). He is super charming and probably has some kind of [devil](../creatures/devils) blood, like he was a devil that became a vampire. He brings me drinks and I tell him the story, maybe a little bit more than I intended to let slip. But basically, [Invictus's phylactery](../relics/necronomicon) was cleansed, sending his clean soul back into his [undead](../creatures/undead) body, causing the massive explosion. I also tell him that Invictus is still there in [the manor](../locales/evershroud-manor), but can't get out.\n\nFreki communes with his birds. Hugin and Munin land on his shoulder and \"remember together.\" He gets a flash of what the birds saw: Lestache and an [unknown halfling](../dossiers/frokim-stillwind) are meeting. Lestache asks \"Frokim\" who he brought. She was a perimeter defender, fancied herself a captain, but that's against the rules, so Frokim made sure she got caught and exiled. She'll be on the outskirts of the southwest border, at the edge of Gangrel territory. Lestache wants to withhold payment until she's delivered straight to him, but caves and pays Frokim. Lestache doesn't really look too unhappy.\n\nFreki asks if Hugin and Munin can find the captive halflings and let them free? They agree to look and say it would take time. The caves are endless, but they will search. Munin says Freki was destined for more than just \"keeping the peace.\" \n\nThere's a brief vamp fight. The band stops playing while they fight, then starts up again when there's a clear winner.\n\nLater, Lestache (who is announced as \"Your host Lestache de Lyarcourt, Fragrant Flower of the Ch\u00e2teau de M\u00e9cant) asks if everybody is ready for the first event of the evening. There's a smattering of applause and someone yells, \"What is it, Lestache?\" He keeps doing his ringmaster thing. He promises he has something \"weird and wonderful\" and hypes up the crowd.\n\nA big box, covered with a dark curtain, gets rolled into the hall. The curtain is pulled away with a flourish to reveal:\n\n\n\n*What* even *is* that? It's undead, probably unique, but I can't tap into my knowledge proficiencies anymore! My [goddess badge](../rules/dual-goddess) seems to have gotten all tingly, so I take it off and look at it. [Erathis](../dossiers/erathis) isn't there anymore!!! Instead it's [Avandra](../dossiers/avandra) on both sides! I hear her laughter in my mind. \"Good job,\" indeed. I am shook!\n\nBec is also astonished by this creature. It's so creepy! It moves in jagged fits of blurred motion, hard to predict where it will be at any given moment. Lestache says he has clearly outdone himself, and I can't really disagree. Even Goratrix is fascinated by this thing.\n\nMalak steps forward and says, \"I could try.\" Lestache is like, \"Are you ma -- oh, I forgot.\" Actually, it turns out Malak doesn't actually want to fight for themself. There are three other very intense, crazy-eyed vampires ready to go. They've been working on a project. They all confer amongst themselves to see who remembered to bring the project.\n\nMalak pulls a sword out of a sack. No! Reaches back in and pulls out nothing. \"This bag is empty!\" Then Malak turns the bag all the way inside out and an old man falls out. It's Zombie [Malachai](../dossiers/malachai-hawthorne)!\n\nMalak is unimpressed. Making dead people alive is old news. But the subordinates assures Malak that this is what is left of Malachai's soul. It's Ghost Malachai! Ghostachai? He says, \"Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhh\" and Malak is onboard.\n\nThe two creatures don't seem particularly hostile toward one another, so Lestache invites Goratrix to help out. Goratrix does one of his unique incantations and a *forcecage* appears around the creatures. The two-torsoed thing starts smashing against the bars of the cage. Ghost Malachai takes everything in and focuses on the two-torsoed thing, who shoots a ray of flame from its staff at Malachai&mdash;but it passes right through him. Malachai then rushes toward the creature, passing into her body and possessing her with his ghostly powers!\n\nThen the two-torsoed thing phases through the bars of the cage!!! The vampires all jump back, and the thing zigzags out. One vampire somewhere in the crowd yells, \"Rip off!\"\n\nLestache is like, \"Huh, that was unexpected.\"\n\n\"That sucked!\" heckles the heckler. Lucky for him vampires can't eat other vampires. Can they?\n\nAnyway, seeing as the crowd is getting restless, Lestache moves the hunt up from midnight to now. The quarry has arrived, so he just needs a few moments to prepare.\n\nHe leaves and comes back with [Orlok](../dossiers/orlok) (\"the Lady of Whispers, Countess of the Underground\", to which she responds \"I'm no lady\") and [Elloia](../dossiers/elloia-canarl) (\"Warden of the Accursed Tunnels, Servant to None But Him\"). Lestache announces the Council of Seven is complete. Another box gets wheeled in. Lestache says the quarry for today is something truly special. \"A halfling guardswoman. She was a perimeter defender, and even fancied herself a Captain, and champion of the downtrodden! Her people repaid her service by exiling her from their wretched community.\" He's really playing this up.\n\n[Sophie Steelboots](../dossiers/sophie-steelboots) is her name, and she is looking hopeless. Lestache offers to let us join the hunt as \"Clan [SPI](../orgs/spi)\" if we ante up an item to throw in the pot. The quarry gets to choose one item to use, and the rest stay in the pot. If we win, then she goes free and we win the pot. But we have no protection if we join the hunt. The vampires are free to attack us however they want.\n\nThe vampire clans all pony up magical objects:\n- Lestache / Toreador: [Instrument of Illusions](https://5e.tools/items.html#instrument%20of%20illusions_xge)\n- Enoch / Ventru: \"The Ventru accept your gracious offer, and pledge in return this [Needle of Mending](https://5e.tools/items.html#needle%20of%20mending_egw)\n- Goratrix / Crispic: Bag of ten [Mind Crystals of Subtlety](https://5e.tools/items.html#mind%20crystal%20%28subtle%29_pabtso)\n- Troile / Brujah: [Ruby of the War Mage](https://5e.tools/items.html#ruby%20of%20the%20war%20mage_xge)\n- Elloia / Gangrel: [Boots of False Tracks](https://5e.tools/items.html#boots%20of%20false%20tracks_xge)\n- Malak / Malkavian: [Manual of Gainful Exercise](https://5e.tools/items.html#manual%20of%20gainful%20exercise_dmg)\n- Orlok: \"The Nosferatu decline to hunt.

She said she had only encountered them once, as hostiles, and she barely escaped with her life.\n* After a time, the party discovered several plumes of smoke, the Stormherd encampment.\n* Outside the encampment, some yak kids are crowded around a scorpion and a spider, while the two creatures viciously fight. Cal notices one yak child slumped against a tree, apparently sleeping despite the noise. The children ran away once the yaks detected the party nearby.\n* The party requested entrance into the camp to speak with Solomon, who they had learned was a powerful diviner. The yaks initially refused to let the party in, but Bec convinced them that the party was elementally balanced (which was apparently somehow important to the yaks). Naamah the spokesyak was the only one who spoke Common.\n* Zanqaa the Devoted, an obsequious dao genie servant, appeared. He extended his master Solomon's invitation for the party to spend the night and witness the Joining of the Elements ceremony at dawn.\n* Bec threw veggies on the ceremonial fires in an attempt at cultural respect. She tried to grab some of the ash from the fire, but the yaks stopped her.\n* Ghensh sang songs of his ancestors, and their (fictional) partnership with the yakfolk in past efforts to spread their race across Aecus.\n* The party started poking around the camp. They found Grosh'mog the orc in a cage in one of the tents. He told them he was an oracle from the Blood Hand, and said the yaks were planning to sacrifice him very soon now. He begged them to free him.\n* While party members debated whether to do so, Zanqaa appeared again and said his master was ready to receive them.\n* As the party entered Solomon's pavilion, they found three strong-looking guards inside, who Kavaki recognized as the ones she had fought previously. Solomon was sitting up in a king-size four-post bed. Next to him on one side was an end table with a spell book, and on the other side of the bed was a large scrying pool.\n* The party had a conversation with Solomon, during which it became clear that his intentions were quite nefarious. While Cal was noticing something odd about one of Solomon's pillows, Bec realized with dawning horror that Solomon must be the one who had somehow orchestrated Kavaki's actions: Kavaki had been attacked by yaks, so Solomon could have been watching her via his scrying pool. She panicked, and shouted, \"Run!\" But the yak guards blocked the party's escape.\n* Solomon shook his head in a tsk tsk sort of way. \"Too bad it has to come to this.

That's why they planted all these agents around in various nations.\n\nI want to know what they know about the white crane tattoo/cult. Several of them react positively.

Bec: \"My Dad, the World Tree, the Elves... will I ever see them again?\" Hoping the World Tree doesn't die...\n\nMeanwhile, Freki accidentally pushes the big red TELEPORT button:\n\n1. Looking around for a button that starts up the sub...\n2. ...sees the big red button... this must be it! Pushes it.\n3. Too late, notices the label next to it that says \"TELEPORT HOME \u2013 FOR EMERGENCIES ONLY\"\n4. Hears a build-up of energy...\n5. ...and the sub pops out of existence.\n6. Freki feels rattled around... like the sub is looking for somewhere to go...\n7. ...but there is nowhere for it to go. It's disconnected from reality here.\n8. So, the pent up epic conjuration magic EXPLODES, filling the vacuum of the void!\n\nThe party feels this magical wave wash over them, reality rushing in. As it does so, the thoughts in their minds are made manifest in fascinating ways:\n\n1. Freki remembers the ancient merfolk city that the aboleths had projected as an illusion, sensing it must have been based in historical reality. He imagines the city at its prime, and the merfolk metropolis begins to coalesce!\n2. Oz: \"What fun would life be if they weren't chasing me?\" He finds himself standing in an ill-gotten pile of gold and jewels and gems.\n3. Cal: \"Can I use my whip to rescue my friends?\" His whip is suffused with epic magical power, becoming the Whip of Rescue +1 (Reach, Finesse).\n4. Vondal's banishment spell eliminates the divide between this place and the prime material plane, dissolving its barrier. As the realm is made manifest, he thinks quickly, visualizing the largest library ever built, open to the public, and it becomes part of the city!\n5. Bec sees a vision of Sartus Morningdew waiting at a teleportation circle of the SPI.\n6. Callie feels the power of her trident fuse with the realm as it comes into being, a powerful *charm merfolk* effect. The corrupted fish folk are restored to merfolk, who now believe in their hearts that the SPI agents are the ones from the other side of the Waters of Antigua! The ones prophesied to save them from the evil sorceress Gwendeviere, who decimated the city with the fierce Dragon Turtle Vorltrarr! But now that nightmare is finally over! The evil sorceress Gwendeviere can never threaten the waters of Antigua ever again, thanks to these brave adventurers!\n\nFortunately, it seems that banishing the aboleths' foul influence restored Linistreya to her normal form as well. But she is still unconscious. Callie heals her and wakes her up. She is very grateful to see her daughter!\n\nThe SPI meets the mermaid princess [Chrandria](../dossiers/chrandria), and her friends [Filiandra](../dossiers/filiandra) and [Shraunna](../dossiers/shraunna), who escort them to the Brotherkings [Aquarmand](../dossiers/aquarmand) and [Harnaqua](../dossiers/harnaqua). They are rewarded with three large chests of treasure in thanks for their valiant efforts stopping the evil sorceress Gwendeviere and her dragon turtle Vorltrarr!\n\nThe agents discuss how to get home. They could take the sub home, but it's a 12-day journey. And they would need to leave some munitions behind to make room for Linistreya. Or they could fix the teleportation circle, updating it to modern standards so that they can teleport.\n\nThey opt for the latter. Once Vondal has finished perusing the incredible library, and Bec has the teleport circle squared away, they teleport back to [SPI HQ](../locales/spi-hq), except for Aurora and Lini, who return to Cognitutus to update the Board of Regents and Rollo on what has transpired. Their plan is to send someone back to Antigua later to retrieve the sub.\n\n### Case file addendum: What happened in Cognitutus?\n\n1. A huge dragon turtle was wrecking the city, bashed in part of the bubble, and the water and sahaguin were streaming in... and then they just... stopped. The dragon turtle swam away back down into the depths, and the sahaguin seemed dazed and confused. When they realized the danger they were in on the front lines, they surrendered.\n2. The Board of Regents were delighted with Aurora and the SPI, issuing a citywide proclamation of herodom honoring their accomplishments.\n3. Rollo was ecstatic to be reunited with Lini. The Rockwells also finalized the deal to sell Euphoria back to the Noffindorfs, so their fortune is saved, and they are able to rehire all of the servants.\n", "id": "events/case-11e09"}, {"title": "The Vanishing", "datestamp": "00-05-02", "when": "50 years ago", "body": "Fifty years ago, the war ended\u2014suddenly.

Maybe it's worth more that way!\n\nThere's no time to think about that, though, because each of the thousands of mirror shards beckon to us with the call of hidden knowledge. Ooh, sparkly! I feel that [Vecna](../dossiers/vecna)'s influence has tainted this place and artifact. I can offer it a secret, which I will lose my knowledge of, and it will give me some piece of hidden knowledge in exchange. [Bec](../dossiers/bec), [Vondal](../dossiers/vondal), and others hear \"Tell me a secret\" and are tempted to answer it.\n\nSome sort of vapor comes out of Vondal's mouth and he hears, \"What you seek is in the crypt.\" He complains about the customer service and demands a refund.\n\nCallie tries to warn Bec that she'll lose any knowledge she offers here, like a sacrifice. But it's too late, Bec offers up [[[[[[the knowledge of karach and its uses]]]]]] something?\n\nBec hears a voice say, \"The time has come for you to accept your destiny. What you seek is here.\" This is followed by a flurry of images of the crypts here, including a correct path and how to open the doors, leading to a pedestal with a hand on it. \"The time has come for a new wielder.\"\n\nCallie's warning gives Bec and Vondal another chance to resist Vecna's temptation. Vondal fails. Bec is tempted. Meanwhile, Oz uses his portable firehose to spray the mirror shards away. Vondal is so entranced that he runs after them, trying to shout his secret (\"[Freki](../dossiers/freki) is a werewooooooooooolllllllfffff!\"). Oz tries to spray Vondal, but it only ends up making him faster. Vondal disappears into the mist!\n\nVondal is lost. Vecna's influence seems more...demanding...here.\n\nBec looks at the portal and realizes we manifested the plane with our energy. So we could reverse the process and eject this plane from here, putting us back in the original room. She thinks this would be the easiest way to get Vondal back. Freki wants to know whether Vondal might instead be lost, but Bec is pretty sure it would be fine.\n\nFreki tries to track Vondal by scent. Callie uses *guidance* to give him a little extra oomph.\n\nMeanwhile, Vondal has given up some piece of knowledge to discover that Freki is \"A pawn of the [Raven Queen](../dossiers/nerull). His [bird](../dossiers/hugin) [companions](../dossiers/munin) are her servants.\" Vondal knows this means Nerull, one of the gods of death.\n\nWhen Freki returns with Vondal, we all exit as Bec suggested. It works! We're all okay and not dead or lost!\n\nVondal informs everybody of what he heard about Nerull and Freki's bird friends. He tries to interrogate them, but nobody knows if they can even talk out loud. They tell Freki, in his mind, that they could speak if he wants them to. Freki asks them to go ahead and speak to Vondal.\n\nVondal asks the birds what the Raven Queen wants with Freki. They say he has a great destiny. Vondal asks them why Freki is a piece on the game board. They say that there is no game board, just what is...and what was...and what will be.... \n\nMunin says, \"He was born under the sign of death.\"  \nHugin says, \"And death follows him.\"  \nBoth: \"He is a bringer of death.\"\n\nThe birds say this power may destroy him one day, or it may save everybody. The power to devour, y'all! Things move forward, and in a circle.\n\nEverybody offers to buy Freki a beer for having to put up with this shit.\n\nAll Freki wants to know is whether he's going to get another shot at killing [Talos](../dossiers/talos). The birds confirm that it's within his destiny and they're all about helping with murder.\n\nFreki asked what part of what they've told him is the most important. \"Not knowing held you back from your true potential. You must meet your true potential. The world depends on it.\"\n\nFreki tries to pin down the birds about the nature of his power, in an attempt to get at the truth of his lost memory. But Munin seems spooked (\"...I can't remember. I should remember...\") and the birds fly off and vanish. Huh.\n\nFreki asks Hugin mentally if they need his help, and Hugin says they are OK, but implores Freki: \"she is the power of memory. She should remember. Find the truth.\"\n\nCallie realizes that the forgetting effect (which is neither a blessing nor a curse, but some kind of anti-divination magic) is from Bec and Vondal offering secrets to Vecna. Dammit! \n\nFreki is convinced that remembering whatever he forgot is the most important thing to do right now, but Bec wants to go down to the crypt and continue investigating down there. Callie agrees with Bec, but on the condition that no one partipate in any paranormal phenomena without the agreement of the rest of the group. YOU GOT THAT, [YOU BUNCH OF MUPPETS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbZ_hTEOKZc)?\n\nVondal checks in on his depressed friend [Roger](../dossiers/roger), from last time he was down here. Roger is the same as before, unsurprisingly.\n\nThey find a door with a hand on it. That's the door that Roger said they couldn't get through because they don't possess the power of the goddess of secrets.\n\nVondal and Oz try to neg Freki into using his magic, which is his secret that he forgot, probably.\n\nBec is the one who opens the door, obviously. Inside is [the Hand](../relics/celestial-hand), surrounded by seven coffins with guardians that will either let us through or try to stop us.\n\n[Cal](../dossiers/cal) feels that the hand is no longer [undead](../creatures/undead), somehow. There are no undead here, in fact. He decides to go look in the coffins. Nothing in there but dust!\n\nThe hand is covered in symbols, many of which are written on the map upstairs. The [central ring symbol](../relics/ring), however, is not.\n\n\n\nObserving the hand, Bec feels the presence of [Sartus Morningdew](../dossiers/sartus-morningdew). She realizes the hand has been cleansed, like the [Necronomicon](../relics/necronomicon). In fact, when the book was cleansed, it also cleansed the hand! Bec thinks back in her mind palace. She thinks the Necronomicon may have been [Invictus](../dossiers/timor-invictus)'s phylactery, in which case his soul was likely pushed out, and may once again reside in a living body. Vecna wanted Bec to know about the hand, but this part was a surprise. Did Vecna not know, then?\n\nCal grabs the hand with his whip. It has a golden chain around its wrist. Nothing happens when Cal takes it. He sticks it in his backpack.\n\nThere is [a dark-skinned elf](../dossiers/sehanine) standing next to Bec. No one can see her but Bec. She's dressed in leathers and is of the night. She whispers, \"Put it on.\" Then she melts back into the forest. Bec is pretty sure the hand will help them recover their lost memories, but Cal isn't convinced that it's entirely un-evil. Oz uses panache on Cal to convince him to give Bec the hand. He also wants to cut off Bec's hand and replace it with this magical one, so maybe we aren't going to take all his suggestions.\n\nUnder Oz's persuasion, Cal reconsiders his position. While he's pondering, he notices that [his sword](../relics/arkenstone) is glowing like an ember, like there is fiery energy. It gets brighter when he moves it closer to the hand and dims when he moves it away. He asks Callie what she thinks. She tells him that the hand has the same kind of energy as the sword, and that's why they light up when they're together.\n\nCal allows Bec to take the hand out of his bag (with *mage hand*, because the other thing in his bag is a severed angel head). Divine energy washes over her. It does not try to kill her, for now. She thinks she can use the hand to manifest something like *divination*. She asks the hand, \"What steps should be taken to restore the memory of Munin?\"\n\nThis knowledge does not want to be known. Bec has to push through it. But she does get the tip, \"He must lose control.\" She would have gotten a better answer if the knowledge wasn't so protected, but she tells Freki that he has to lose control.\n\nBec opens the door that Roger said we'd never get through. He says, \"You found it\" but not excitedly, then goes back into the servant's quarters.\n\nInside is a mystical chamber. Invictus likes weird-shaped rooms, it seems. There are 16 walls in here, which have either a tapestry, a door, or a shelf on it. The shelves hold all sorts of books, potions, and items for performing ritual magic. Including some real strange and forbidden stuff. Bec wants to close the door and leave, but Vondal has his foot in it and Oz is also pushing to get in. They bust in like Larry and Curly.\n\nThen Freki and Bec close the door behind them, the perfidious bastards! They are super creeped out by this room. I'll forgive them someday.\n\nInside, Cal notices that one of the tapestries seems un-tapestry-like. Oz whips out his blade and slashes it. It was enchanted to conceal what was behind it, but that's all. There's an archway behind it and a dismal, reddish glow across the threshold. This is the glow of the manor suffused in the air. \n\nVondal opens the door for Callie and they all (minus Freki and Bec) go to investigate the door. Walking through, there's a gross metallic taste in the air. There's an angel of some kind with bloody wings. There are glowing tendrils connecting him to parts of the room. He seems to be suffering.\n\nAlso, there's some creep in the corner of the room! It's [Malachai](../dossiers/malachai-hawthorne)! This seems like it might be the real one, not the fake one we killed earlier. He complains that he's alive again and his whole setup with the crystalline heart is all messed up.\n\nInvictus says, \"You must destroy this place,\" referring to all of [Arallu](../locales/arallu). \"You must burn it all down. It should never have existed.\"\n\nMalachai says, \"I dunno, I think it's pretty great!\"\n\nInvictus says, \"Shut up. You were never my servant. You belonged to something that should never be. Undead are abominations. They act like humans, but they are not humans. They must all be destroyed. If they come here, this power could destroy them, but they are too cunning for that.\"\n\nInvictus tries to expose his heart so we can kill him. \"No one deserves to suffer like I am!\"\n\nMalachai is like, \"You did do some pretty horrible stuff, yeah.\"\n\nOz tries to shoot Malachai with his mint-condition short bow. It is ineffective, and I'm starting to think Oz has Oppositional Defiant Disorder.\n\nCal asks Callie to go check the ritual room and see what it's for. I think it's where Invictus ate the souls he needed to fuel his unlife. Yrrrghghhh.\n\nInvictus promises to tell us stuff in exchange for us euthanizing him. Cal promises that if the information is good, he will return and kill him. Invictus says the [Brucolac](../dossiers/cronus) was once a god but is now corrupted. That's why [Cal's father](../dossiers/hyperion) hates him so much, because they were brothers.\n\nWhen the world was young, the [gods](../creatures/eternals) overthrew the [titans](../creatures/titans). Hyperion's titan brother [Iapetus](../dossiers/iapetus) created the Book of the Dead in an effort to save the mortally wounded [Cronus](../dossiers/cronus). But something went wrong and Cronus became the Brucolac. For a time the book was lost, but it was ultimately rediscovered by Invictus, who took the opportunity to bind his soul to it to make himself immortal. As for [the ghost](../dossiers/janus-ilaris), he is an enigma. [Something happened fifty years ago](../events/the-vanishing) that no one understands and Invictus can't remember. But the vial of divine essence, which Invictus wanted to use to free himself from lichdom, had to come from somewhere. All of us now contain some of that power, which he theorizes came from [a dead god](../dossiers/yondalla). Oz and Cal wield great power of destruction. He wants them to use it on him. He's been alive far too long and done too many horrible things.\n\nMalachai would like to continue doing bad things, thanks!\n\nCallie asks Invictus whether we need to do something special to kill him. It has to be an amount of power equal to that which did this to him, so, the power of a god. \n\nThe chart upstairs was an attempt to understand what happened when the manor exploded and where the power went. We all gravitated toward certain elements based on our souls, except for Invictus, because he had no soul; he was inverted in some way.\n\nMalachai, Callie, Cal, and Oz head out to the ritual chamber to destroy the really evil stuff. Also, Callie grabs as much of the non-evil magical components as she can and stuffs it into Cal's backpack.\n\nMeanwhile, Malachai silently casts a spell on Callie, but she resists. She can tell he was trying to bind her physically. He complains that he could really use a Ring of Mind Shielding. Ha ha, bet you could! Oz stabs him for his betrayal. The wounds don't heal. Malachai says, \"I just wanted to have the ring, so when I die my soul could go in there and maybe I could come back!\"\n\nUpstairs, Freki hears the whispering in the paintings. Oh, so THAT'S why they call it the Gallery of Whispers! All the paintings are portraits of individual people. Freki is looking for anyone or anything he recognizes, but he doesn't see anything. A woman's portrait beckons him. \"Come to me so I can be free!\" Freki is like, \"Nah, mang.\" He asks if any of them know about Munin. One of them says he might know something if Freki just comes in the painting. Freki asks about assurances. The guy is like, \"You have my fine word, sir.\" Sounds legit!\n\nBec is waiting in the foyer and hears the noise we're making downstairs. She comes in just in time to see Oz stab Malachai in the back. \n\nBec goes in to talk to Invictus. She asks him whether Vecna is still the master of the hand. He is surprised that Bec is able to wear it and thinks even Vecna's power apparently has limits. Bec asks if he can help, and he says no amount of help would make up for the bad things he's done. But he'll try anyway. He mentions the dead god again, and Bec asks if that is the power of the nine elements she saw inscribed on the hand. Invictus is shocked. There were never nine! But if there were... that changes everything! It explains the hole in the world. The gods bound the world with the elements. If one of them has really been destroyed, then the world would be unraveling.\n\n\"You don't know what [the Flux](../locales/flux) is? It is everything that is not the world. It is unreality. The gods bound Aecus so the Flux would be kept out.\" Then he roasts Vondal for thinking he had mastery over such a primordial power.\n\nBec asks Invictus whether it's possible to restore a memory lost to Vecna. He says yes, it's possible to learn something again, but Vecna will exact some kind of toll.\n\nFreki shoots him with some sort of acid arrow. He's in pain, but doesn't die. He says one of the relics or divine magic beyond that could kill him.\n\nOz uses his [divine-powered blade](../relics/cornucopia). Even though it doesn't kill Invictus, Oz keeps right on stabbing him.\n\nThis is obviously not working, so Callie prays to [Erathis](../dossiers/erathis) for guidance. \"The vengeance must be complete. Both [she](../dossiers/yondalla) and [her shadow](../dossiers/dallah-thaun) must be of one mind.\" The vengeance must be against Invictus specifically. I know this is a specific \"she,\" someone ancient and powerful, and there's some reason Erathis can't tell me, perhaps a gap in her knowledge. If there's a \"she\" and a \"shadow\" then it seems they need to be reunited in some way.\n\nOz's stabbing is getting to be...compulsive? He can hear the ghost in his mind possessing him and enjoying this stabbing a LOT. Cal pulls Oz away.\n\nCallie relates what Erathis said to her companions. We can't kill Invictus, but we should definitely take care of Malachai. Cal and Vondal decide to escort him outside. His feet drag and he eventually passes out. Cal tosses him out the front door and he dies.\n\nAs they all walk to the door, Callie thinks over what she heard and tells Cal and Oz that they could have killed Invictus, but they both have to go into it wholeheartedly. It seems Cal's heart is not quite in it now, though.\n", "id": "events/case-14e04"}, {"title": "The Mark of Death", "datestamp": "50-03-19/1b", "when": "end of case 05", "body": "TODO\n", "id": "events/mark-of-death"}, {"title": "[02e01] I Think I'm a Clone Now", "description": "A secret vault in Tremere's manor leads to some harrowing developments.", "datestamp": "50-03-11/01", "when": "AC50 Solis 11", "session-number": 2, "session-date": "2015-06-28", "session-event": "https://www.facebook.com/events/391941907658803/", "body": "1.

He tries to target the lich, but finds no mind to target. At that moment, Tremere accuses Orbach; Vondal swaps his focus! Then he targets the pirate, who is thinking: \"That dick! Of course he tried to frame me! I'd never eat that shitty heart.\"\n* Bec thought the speak with dead should have lasted longer. Vondal believed \"something is wrong with the body\"\u2014like its soul had not transitioned properly to the next plane, but instead had been somehow ripped out.\n* Cal asked whether the Periapt of Health is genuine. Bec detected magic, focusing on the periapt, and saw that it was moderately magical with a conjuration healing aura! It appeared to be real.\n* Freki tried to sniff out where the heart might have gone. But his search was fruitless, and eventually he gave up in frustration. But he did hear a quasi-horrific shrieking from the far door of the library. The door was slightly open, and he saw an arcane laboratory within. The strange shrieking sound was louder here. Freki signaled to Cal, who came closer.\n* The shriek suddenly intensified. The following people proceeded quickly but cautiously to the Preservatory through the Arcane Lab: Cal, Freki, Bec, Bram, Timor, Murky. They passed a beholder in a jar! And all kinds of pickled somethings. There were also skulls and scented candles.\n* The following people refused to be distracted and remained with the body: Vondal, Priscilla, Alex and Sartus.\n* Where did Tybalt Nightbreeze go? He was lost in the shuffle...\n* The SPI fought the murderous shrieking mega plant!\n  * It grabbed the pirate with its main tentacle, and ate him shortly thereafter.\n  * Invictus fed the plant a previously-unseen corpse hanging from the ceiling, which kept the plant distracted for a moment.\n  * Freki shot it with an arrow (which worked! Was the geas not applicable somehow? Or no longer in effect?), then ring-of-jumped down its gullet.\n  * Cal Indiana-Jones'd down to the ground with his whip, but couldn't stab through the plant's thick outer casing.\n  * Bec pelted the plant with magic missiles.\n  * Vondal came running when Murky told him what was going on, dove onto the catwalk, tripping and falling as he cast slow, which rebounded off the plant tainted with necromantic energy, and seeped into him. The plant then slammed him with tentacles till he almost died. He was almost necromantically reincarnated into something horrible, but narrowly saved by Bec, who used a healing potion and a very prudent dispel magic to unravel his curse before it festered\u2014resulting in a harmless explosion of wild magic butterflies, aww!\n  * Invictus conjured a Bigby's Hand and grappled the plant, holding its mouth shut so that it would stop eating people.\n  * A partially digested Freki Hulked out, transforming into a werewolf, and tore his way out like the Kool-aid Man. \"I coulda done that!\" said Bram. Freki almost devoured the heart of his enemy, but thought better of it when: A) the pirate shouted \"Don't do it, man!\" at him, and B) he felt vile necromancy spreading down his limb even in the first moments of his holding it.\n* Invictus: \"Poor Matilda. Lucky you dispatched her before she replicated.\"\n* But the zombies got loose! Someone must have opened the first floor door. They were streaming all over the place: into the Preservatory, up the stairs, into the Hall of Victory... Invictus used the Bigby's Hand to shove them around, then commanded them to lie down, then commanded them back into the room.\n* Orbach somehow slipped away from Stormcloud and Morningdew unnoticed. Bec looked around, and noticed something unseen (invisible? Hard to tell) lurking in the torture chamber. Then it disappeared (did it jump down into the pit\u203d), and Cal noticed something unseen (invisible? Hard to tell) shouldering zombies out of the way in the 1st floor doorway. Cal whipped it good, tripping Orbach. The party dogpiled him, took away his gear, tied him up, and dragged him back to the Study. \"I almost made it,\" he said, \"I guess it's time to make a deal.\"\n", "id": "events/case-07e05"}, {"title": "Fire at SPI headquarters", "datestamp": "50-01-30", "when": "before the campaign", "body": "TODO\n", "id": "events/spi-fire"}, {"title": "[Case 06] Mutilation and Metamorphosis", "description": "A tribe of gnolls has been slaughtered by a terrifying blast of Flux.", "datestamp": "50-03-24/00", "when": "AC50 Solis 24 - Cudo 07", "body": "### Victims\n\nThe [Manufeai](../orgs/manufeai), a tribe of [gnolls](../creatures/gnolls) reknowned for being vicious carnivores.\n\n### Crime scene\n\nThe Manufeai appear to have been killed by some sort of Flux-related event: their bodies are twisted and some look like [demons](../creatures/demons) (Ni: \"they grew stronger in death\").\n\nWhen the SPI arrived, their leader, Rohna (female, gnoll, cleric of Yeenoghu), rose as some kind of demonic entity; other tribe members became [vargouilles](../creatures/vargouilles).\n\n### Witness\n\nThere was a witness: [Freki](../dossiers/freki), a wildling ranger.

Callie healed Kavaki. Cal rescued Freki from the stream before he drowned. Vondal made sure Sabrina was OK, and gave her a cookie.\n2. The party talked to Kavaki. At first, she did not want to say anything, saying that her story was too strange and unbelievable. But the SPI convinced her to tell them anyway, with Vondal explaining that it was their job to believe what most people find unbelievable.\n\n  * Kavaki claimed that she was ambushed while sleeping in the jungle, and that somehow her body was taken over by a foreign power, which physically compelled her to take all the actions that she did. She was fully conscious and aware while her body returned to the Malosi encampment, asked Sabrina to make the Flux Capacitor, took it on a several-days-long solo march through the jungle to the Manufeai, and wordlessly murdered them with it. She also remembers her body using it to absorb some sort of essence or energy from the slain gnolls afterward, and it resonating strongly afterward. Her body then marched her far to the south, where she laid down and was bludgeoned unconscious by unseen persons.\n  * When she awoke, the Flux Capacitor was gone, she stumbled a few steps, and found herself at the stream with Sabrina, Mengiris and the SPI.\n\n3. Bec checked the area where Kavaki had come from, and found a series of concentric circles with energy directed inward. She theorized that Sabrina had somehow unwittingly transported Kavaki here using her power.\n4. Kavaki's flux tattoos started acting up. Even though Callie healed her, she seemed like she was slipping away somehow. Vondal tried to channel wild magic at a tattoo\u2014it resonated and he felt like he was in perfect harmony with the surge of wild energy as the orange tattoo jumped from her onto his body.\n5. Kavaki was angry, but also seemed slightly more grounded. She sat up a little. The other tattoos were all still wiggly, shimmering and unstable, though. Sabrina believed that Kavaki needed to get the tattoos off her body in order to survive. Normally though, a person can only sustain one tattoo at a time\u2014keeping more at once requires immense strength of will. But Kavaki's will had been weakened by her ordeal.\n6. Kavaki did not want to lose her tattoos, but Cal had a conversation with her in the tongue of giants, affirming that those responsible must be brought back into the Ordning\u2014giant culture's concept of a unified justice and order to the giantkind and the universe as a whole. Cal swore an oath to help Kavaki do this, and Kavaki agreed to lend the SPI her tattoos, as Cal directed.\n7. After some discussion, the SPI agents agreed to each shoulder the burden of a tattoo. Sabrina declined to have one, and no one asked Mengiris or other Malosi.\n8. The seven tattoos are: green ([biofeedback](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/psionic-powers/b/biofeedback), DR 4/- for 7 min.); blue ([defy gravity](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/psionic-powers/d/defy-gravity), 1 hour, self only); yellow ([time hop](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/psionic-powers/t/time-hop/), 5 rounds forward, Will DC 15 negates); orange ([hustle](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/psionic-powers/h/hustle)); red ([hammer](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/psionic-powers/h/hammer), 4 touches at 3d8 each); violet ([vigor](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/psionic-powers/v/vigor/), 20 temporary HP); and black ([truevenom](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/psionic-powers/t/truevenom/), Fort DC 15). Tattoos recharge after one hour.\n9. The tattoos also imbue some personalized metaphysical power upon each character. Players (out of game decision) can activate these powers once per session, as needed. The powers are merely guidelines\u2014anything that fits the character is appropriate here.\n\n  * Bec - Prevailing truth (Arcana, History, Nature, Religion). The tree of infinite possibility appears before you, you see branches which must be eliminated\u2014and a powerful truth remains.\n  * Freki - Animal instinct (Survival). You smell emotions, even as they fade, and can even track people by the \"emotional trail\" they leave.\n  * Cal - Healthy skepticism (Perception). You notice something subtly out of place, which everyone else is taking for granted.\n  * Callie - Inspired reading (Insight). You have a supernatural flash of inspiration which yields a line of questioning that, together with a subject's body language and response tone, is likely to extract a secret from them.\n  * Vondal - Lucid memory (Luck). You remember something from the past which is relevant.\n  * Ghensh - Stranger than fiction (Performance). You perceive the narrative arc of the universe, compelling you to burst into an impromptu story which parallels reality.\n\n10. Sabrina channeled immense psychic energy to transplant the tattoos as directed by Cal. Everyone's heads went fully fuzzy; when the psychic fuzz cleared, a dragonborn named Ghensh Faass was present, bearing one of the tattoos. This was completely expected and normal to everyone present\u2014he had always been there. (It seems the flux tattoos are somehow linked to unstable reality, much like the Flux as a whole.) And there was never any black tattoo\u2014there are only six.\n11. In response to this metaphysical outburst, the Malosi tribe chieftain Talos appeared. He challenged the SPI's presence in \"his domain.\" Talos appeared as a well-muscled centaur with much bling (magical and otherwise), a spiked chain easily accessible on his flank, and a missing joint on one finger. He was arrogant and superior, but perceptive, disdainfully referring to Freki as a \"lycan.\" Cal's sword drew his interest, and he requested(!) to handle it more closely. Cal sensed his avarice and refused; Talos backed down and allowed the SPI to leave without a fight in pursuit of the flux weapon.\n12. Kavaki agreed to lead them through the jungle in the direction she went before. They headed south for some days, but noticed nothing immediately relevant to their investigation during the journey. On the third evening, Kavaki told them they had gone farther south than she was at the time she was bludgeoned and left for dead.\n13. The party made camp to discuss what to do next.\n\n  * Bec checked the compass and noted: Manufeai (fanged tooth) pointed NNE; Malosi (finger bone) pointed N; Blood Hand Orcs (patch of skin) pointed NW; Stormherd (clump of fur) pointed W.\n  * Callie threw a prophecy bead in the fire: \"The hounds are on the trail, and soon will catch the scent. Heed the raven.\"\n\n14. The next morning, a raven hopped on Freki's face, and pecked him awake. \"Hello! I am Munin,\" it told Freki's mind.\n", "id": "events/case-06e04"}, {"title": "[06e06] The Union of the Elements", "description": "Solomon battle.

That didn't seem to have been the plan.\n* Solomon called the genie and asked for his final wish. The genie said \"As you wish, Master\" and it was creepy so Bec took matters into her own hands with a Magic Missile. This got her stabbinated by the spear-wielding yak guard.\n* The genie unwound time in an attempt to retrieve the Flux Capacitor from before it was destroyed.

Unfortunately, due to the clock's gnomish overcomplexity, only an expert on the clock's inner workings would be able to deduce the actual time when the breakage occurred.\n14.

There's nothing behind it, much to his disappointment. [Freki](../dossiers/freki) finds some Glowcap mushrooms growing in something like a compost pile. Freki sniffs it and it smells like plant matter, but also slightly like decaying flesh.\n\nPeering out the window, we can see what looks like a bell tower and maybe a churchyard of some kind. It looks like the [vampires](../creatures/vampires) probably killed whoever was here before and moved in. The churchyard, where Bilbo lives, is mostly falling apart.\n\n[Bec](../dossiers/bec) looks around to see if Bilbo has any books. He does have a journal, so Bec flips through it. He writes a lot! She does a *detect magic* ritual for five minutes. The journal is not magical, although it has an illusion magic residue, as though something enchanted with illusion magic touched it a few times. Reading a few entries, Bec finds an incriminating passage: \"I do what I can to prevent them from rising as undead, at least,\" and we think Bilbo may be killing halflings when he can get away with it. He has also been used as a lure for other halflings. Poor Bilbo, we should help him. :((((\n\nFreki and Oz are suspicious of Bilbo's motives, but with my religion/vampire lore knowledge, I can assure them that no undead creature would have all these symbols of Nerull.\n\nI'm going to try to sleep. That ale really snuck up on me!\n\nThere's a banging on the door and a non-vampiric voice says, \"Meatbags! You have been summoned!\"\n\nBec is like, \"Who is it?\"\n\nIt's probably a candygram.\n\nBilbo opens the door from the other side and he's there with a [ghast](../creatures/undead). The ghast's tongue is lolling and drooling all over, gross. Bilbo says, \"Sorry about that. Don't mind him. He's always hungry.\"\n\nFreki asks him about why there's flesh bits in the mushroom soil. The ghast is like \"fleeeeeeeesssshhhhh???\"\n\nBilbo sighs and comes inside with his magic carpet so we can talk without this distraction. He reassures us that dinner is \"not likely to be you, this time.\"\n\nOz has had it with these motherfucking vampires in this motherfucking town! He's still very keen to liberate the [halfling town](../locales/xaryuvia). He uses Panache to get Bilbo on our side. Bilbo admits that he is all for this plan, but if we attack [Lestache](../dossiers/lestache-de-lyarcourt) he'll have no choice (*twitch twitch*) but to turn against us. He also says it is his fate to serve Nerull. Nerull loves fate, it's her thing.\n\nOz starts talking about how we could disguise someone as Bilbo, which makes Bilbo understandably nervous. He starts backing away slowly.\n\nAnyway, there's no obvious way out of this, so Oz tries to whack Bilbo with the pommel of his sword. But before he can, Bilbo slips his hand into his pocket and disappears. Dammit!\n\nOz grabs the magic carpet. Freki smells where Bilbo is and attempts to grapple him. Bilbo is surprisingly slippery and wriggles away!\n\nCal all of a sudden whips the air and catches Bilbo!

Vondal closes the door behind us, so we are locked in here, but at least all the ghosts are out there, I guess.\n\nOkay, most of the ghosts are outside. A swarm of ghosts appears at the opposite end of the church. Freki has the impression that they're here for some reason, maybe to protect something. Looking around, Bec and I wonder if this may have been a church of Peylor at one time, though it's hard to tell. Its original purpose has been corrupted. Vondal feels that something happened to pull this place partly out of reality.\n\nIt is extremely quiet here. Weirdly silent. Vondal creates a wall of light between us and the ghost swarm that also illuminates the whole place. There's a sarcophagus at the altar of the church, behind the ghosts. The Death Tyrant is there, with withered tentacles that are still moving. There are three stained glass windows. A goddess is depicted in two of them, but her face is obscured in a creepy way. The final window depicts...something other than what it originally did. It looks like the vision that we saw a while ago of the Brucolac, as well as the Necronomicon that we destroyed. That's surprising, since Goratrix told us that vampires were forbidden from entering here. This place is supposed to be ruled by the Spirit. Bec speculates that maybe our cleansing of the Necronomicon might have done something to the Brucolac too, but we don't really know.\n\nHauntedness increases as we approach the sarcophagus. We're all at at top stealth mode and ghosts don't make any noise, so everything is still eerily silent, but it does seem like they're investigating us.

He jumped up on a table, tankard in hand. \"Beggin' your pardon, but\u2026 I don't need to go in that room to make an offer. Listen up, me hearties. If I end up with that juice, then you (points to Stormcloud) get on my boat. You (points to Sartus and Tybalt), I'll fix your Tree. You (points to Invictus) can't use it anyway; and I'll get your book back for ya. You (points to the SPI), I'll tell you what happened to the rest of the SPI, and who was responsible. You (points to Orbach): you can be a pirate on my pirate ship; I know you want to. And you (pointing to Tremere): you get nothing; fuck you. And now: I gotta go take a shit. Think about it.\" And he stomps out of the parlor into the foyer.\n* Next, Stormcloud called Janus Ilaris. Tybalt channeled Janus. Tybalt hung like a marionette, floating/hanging with toes off the ground, with dead eyes, hair standing on end. Janus was translucent, wearing elven finery, floating an inch off the ground.\n* Meanwhile, Cal sneaked out of the room after Tremere and Invictus, who had slunk off to have a private chat. He listened at the door of (what he later learned is) the \"Preservatory.\"\n  * Tremere: \"What will it take to get you off my back?\"\n  * Invictus: \"I want your warforged.\"\n  * Tremere pauses. \"No deal.\"\n  * Invictus (surprised/intrigued): \"The pirate was right: you don't have it anymore!\"\n  * Tremere (angrily): \"Of course I still have it!\"\n  * Invictus, no longer interested. \"We have nothing left to discuss.\"\n  * And Cal heard Tremere's stomping feet coming toward the door.\n  * Cal hid in the shadow of a foyer staircase, but Tremere noticed him\u2014\"What are you looking at?\"\n  * Tremere stomped back to the parlor, trying but physically failing to break a decorative lamp.\n* Tybalt, still as Janus, emerged. Stormcloud seemed more pleased with how the meeting went.\n* Stormcloud called the SPI. They wrangled Vondal from the library. Cal followed the ghost into the dining area, where he discovered Tybalt having a private conversation with it. \"Begone, mortal!\" the ghost spoke in a deep supernatural voice, gestured dramatically and psionically pushed Cal out of the room.\n* Afterward, back to normal, Tybalt apologized for his patron's rudeness. \"If you want to compare notes after your meeting, seek me out. Good luck.\"\n* Callie, Vondal and Cal entered the study with Stormcloud. \"You have the best leverage. If you turn over both artifacts to me, I will give you the vial.\" Both artifacts? Stormcloud revealed that the pommel of Cal's sword is in fact the Arkenstone, the artifact of Light. Vondal and Cal realized that the timelines match up for when the stone disappeared, and when Hyperion (Cal's guardian?) gave it to Cal. (Cal realized that Hyperion used the Giant word \"instrument\" when describing the sword, which at the time Cal had thought was merely a formalism of the situation, but he has now understood to mean something like \"cardinal tool\").\n* The party negotiated with Stormcloud. They offered to give her the Lamp, and let her study Cal's stone between missions, with Cal's supervision.\n* While Stormcloud considered the offer, Callie asked to speak with her privately.\n  * Cal and Vondal left the room, seeing that only Timor Invictus was currently in the study, standing motionless in one corner.\n  * Meanwhile, Callie asked Stormcloud whether she knew anything about a puzzlebox. \"You speak of the artifact of Knowledge, yes? The owner is in attendance at this auction.\"\n* Before Callie could ask anything further, a wave (of unmagic? or Flux?) washed over the room. Cal and Vondal could feel that the wave did not originate from the study, but rather the opposite direction from them.\n* The lights went out; the room was lit by glowing green flames of a [flameskull](../creatures/flameskulls) near the study ceiling. Stormcloud sprang into action, calling out: \"Take them down! But please avoid collateral damage.\"\n* The SPI battled the flameskulls:\n  * The skulls moved quickly, shooting fire rays from their eyes, burning Callie and Vondal badly.\n  * Stormcloud then used mass protection from energy to give fire resistance to the agents.\n  * Cal stabbed one with an expert strike of his sun blade, and a wave of energy exploded outward from the pommel, damaging two enemies.\n  * Callie channeled her goddesses into an undead turning effect which destroyed the flameskull Cal had weakened most, and sent the other two fleeing into a corner of the parlor.\n  * Vondal hammered the two remaining skulls with scorching rays (crit!), before realizing that they were immune to fire-based attacks. However, he could feel that the matrix of his magic was, incredibly, completely aligned in a manner that made his attacks completely reliable, and more effective than usual.\n  * The skulls continued to flee, since they had not taken any damage.\n  * Stormcloud readied a counterspell, cautioning the agents to finish off the monsters quickly.\n  * Cal could not reach them, but pulled out his whip and hit one, which snapped it out of its panic to flee.\n  * Callie summoned a spiritual weapon, and blasted the damaged skull with sacred flame.\n  * Vondal hit the two skulls with an augmented witchbolt, which was again super effective, destroying one and damaging the other.\n  * The remaining skull tried to manifest a fireball in its mouth, but Stormcloud countered it with a chopping motion. She then readied another counterspell, saying, \"I can only do that once more! Finish it quickly!\"\n  * The agents slung more attacks at it. The skull tried to manifest a flaming sphere but it was again countered. Finally, Cal destroyed it with a final blow.\n  * They looked around warily, but saw no more foes.\n* Soon after the battle, the lights flickered and the room returned to normal.\n* A loud knock was heard in the distance, which Vondal recognized as the spell of that name being used somewhere nearby.\n* Less than a minute later, Timor Invictus reappeared in the parlor. \"I'm afraid I have bad news. Someone has died. I suggest you come quickly.\"\n", "id": "events/case-07e03"}, {"title": "[14e03] Go Flux Yourself", "description": "TODO", "datestamp": "50-06-03/03", "when": "AC50 Vis 03", "session-number": 65, "session-date": "2023-11-18", "session-event": "https://www.facebook.com/events/2347533262301919/", "body": "## Callie's Journal\n\n[Lady Nightshade](../dossiers/ilyana-nightshade) challenges [Callie](../dossiers/callie) to drink it again. Callie passes, but only barely and only with [Vondal](../dossiers/vondal)'s help, again!\n\nVondal shows her the SPI badge (?). She says, \"You are the ones we need.\" She then swings her scythe and rips a hole in reality through which we can see the pulse of the [Flux](../locales/flux). She punches into the rift and grabs the Flux. It starts crawling up her arm. Gross! This could [give her immense power](https://youtu.be/1qlegJJ1RTA?t=487). [Bec](../dossiers/bec) and Callie think that the Flux is using her more than the other way around, though.\n\n[Freki](../dossiers/freki) shoots into the rift with a lightning arrow and the Flux snaps the angel's arm off at the elbow. She's kinda pissed! And also made out of mouths! The mouths shriek, \"We will consume you aaaaaalllllll!\"\n\n[![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/77/be/6b/77be6be97547963b4cd34e69c637c2a2.jpg){:style=\"max-height:300px\"}](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/454441418662038437/)\n\n\"We should kill these people,\" says [Oz](../dossiers/oz).\n\n\"How?!\" demands Freki.\n\n\"With violence, how else do you kill people?\" Oz says.\n\nThe magic surrounding the sexy Chippendale angels breaks, and they turn into glowing balls of light with faintly visible visages within.\n\n[![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f7/55/bb/f755bbb37e902e49c8a291c81b56a67c.jpg){:style=\"max-height:300px\"}](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/560768591098538655/)\n\nA residual psychic echo enwreathes the balls of light: fading images of [flaming skulls](../creatures/flameskulls), which they once were. The charm they were running on Oz broke when they became heads, so he's only charmed by the angel now.\n\nBec, Vondal, and Callie sense that the angel has an overwhelming desire to eat us, as opposed to what she wanted earlier. Nom nom nom. She was consumed by her need to consume. Callie thinks when she said \"we\" she didn't mean her skulls, but someone else we haven't seen yet. And also something more sinister, perhaps from beyond reality itself. Jinkies! Maybe we should try being worse at our jobs, to avoid inspiring this kind of behavior.\n\nOz attacks one of the skulls and stabbinates it. The [hornblade](../relics/cornucopia) has necrotic, poisonous damage. Its negative energy cuts through the positive energy of the room. The glowy flamy light of the skull dims. Oz skewered it good, so it's stuck like a shishkebab now.\n\nAll the foes attempt to intimidate us. Oz and Cal are afraid, but everyone else shakes it off. The skulls hit Oz (and Cal?) with a beam of light that sucks some of his life force into Lady Nightshade. The unicorn taps Oz with its horn and he regains some health!\n\nVondal tries to banish Lady Nightshade and one of the skulls, but unfortunately he becomes terrified of Freki and also drunk. He does regain some spell slots, so...nice? But the spell succeeds somehow, and Lady Nightshade and the skull disappear.\n\nCallie casts Calm Emotions (lvl 2) and the party members who were frightened or charmed are calm now. Yay!\n\nJust then, reality slice apart and Lady Nightshade starts climbing out of the rift. She's mutated even further, somehow! Freki decides to shoot her in the face again, assuming he can find it. He manages to get her right in the neck and the rift snaps shut, slicing her head clean off. Cal catches it like a goddamn basketball!\n\nOz attacks the skull he attacked before, whose wounds were slowly closing up. He destroys it.\n\nThe unicorn gives Vondal a goodbye tap with its horn and vanishes.\n\nBefore Oz can murderate the remaining skull, Bec tells the party to hold up. She wants to ask it some questions. The skull tells her she is not of this place, but she seems cool, so it will tell her what she wants to know.\n\nWhere is the positive energy coming from? The Master.  \nWho is the Master? The Master is the Master.  \nWhere is the Master? Below.  \nThe Master was once called [Timor Invictus](../dossiers/timor-invictus), but not anymore.  \nVondal asks how we can kill him. You know, so we can make sure that never happens.  \nThe skull says Timor is stuck in a realm of endless suffering. He's tried to die, but can't. That's kinda sad! The skull doesn't want us to kill him, but maybe there's a way to, ahem, end his suffering. That would be the kind thing to do.\n\nThe skull starts shaking and sparking. A figure superimposes on top of it. In a ragged voice, it says, \"You've come. I will be waiting.\"\n\nThe skull says, \"My master calls!\" and flies away downstairs.\n\nBy the time we're done talking, Cal and Oz's wounds have healed. The positive energy is almost getting annoying at this point, like, give it a rest already.\n\nThe party takes a quick look around. There's a banquet hall, a magic laboratory, a library. In the lab is a journal written in an elegant hand and signed by Illyana Nightshade. The journal begins 300 years ago. She appears to have been researching how to join Invictus in undeath. She successfully created a Philosopher's Stone, and then she ate it. It does seem to have given her eternal life, but she is now forever hungry and thirsty. Towards the end (about three years ago) are notes about how efforts to cure the insatiable hunger and thirst aren't working. Nothing about splitting apart and become a tooth monster, though.\n\nNext we look around the library. Oz snags a crystal ball that looks valuable. Bec tells him that it's used for scrying. There's a bookmarked story about how Vecna lost her hand.\n\nTimor (probably) tells us to find him upstairs.\n\nUpstairs, there are three main areas: an art gallery, guest rooms, and a study. The skull that went upstairs before is floating around the gallery at random. Well, it's not like the art is going to appreciate itself.\n\nOz checks the study door for traps. It gives him a funny vibe. He grabs Cal and asks him to take a look too. Cal agrees it's weird. They feel like it would be a bad idea to open the door, but there's no clear reason for it. Bec can use Mage Hand to open it safely, perhaps.\n\nMeanwhile, some of us remember when we were talking to Malachai, he mentioned the \"Gallery of Whispers.\" Maybe we should check there? We all gather in there to hide from whatever explosion or whatever is going to happen when the study door opens. She casts Mage Hand, and...the door is...locked.\n\nThe skull whispers, \"Why did you defy the Master?\" to a painting. Each of the paintings is a portrait making an emotional face. Vondal thinks the Mirror of Living Memory might have trapped souls in these paintings. There aren't legends to that effect, but still.\n\nMurky touches a painting and hears a wail of misery. Vondal tells us to touch the paintings. \"It's like a seashell, but instead of the ocean you hear the lamentations of a lost soul!\"\n\nVondal and I grant Bec some extra fate juice as she attempts to remove the trap on the study door with Dispel Magic. She's able to avoid the trap and doesn't set it off. \n\nDoor's still locked, though, so Oz is going to try to pick the lock. Inside, the eight magic domains are scrawled on the floor -- a portal? On the desk is a scroll covered in divine symbols, as well as figures resembling each of us and some of our associates (Sartus, Tybalt, Bram the Blithe, and Timor Invictus). Mine is next to Avandra's symbol, natch. Avanadra appears to be at the intersection of air and sand, whatever that means.\n\nBec wanders away to look at the portal. She knows a lot about portals and can see magical rivulets for channeling magic energy. She postulates that maybe we need to pour each of the types of magical energy into it, in order to activate the portal.\n\nCal looks at the paper with the figures and notices that all the people represented are the ones invited to the undead party before! Nice one, Cal!\n\nEveryone gathers around and tries to figure out the paper with the tokens and symbols. Vondal figures out that the elements correspond to the magic domains:\n\n* Water -- Knowledge\n* Storm -- Tempest\n* Air -- Trickery\n* Sand -- Life\n* Fire -- Light\n* Magma -- War\n* Earth -- Nature\n* Ice -- Death\n\nI'm confused about why [Avandra](../dossiers/avandra) and [Erathis](../dossiers/erathis) are on here under two things, when each represents just one domain. Also, [the combined form](../dossiers/ioun) is also on this chart. What?\n\nCal is inspired and getting this thing solved! Freki is also coming in strong on this puzzle! It occurs to Freki that every square is covered and only one god occupies each one. Maybe this is an illustration of the lines of power in the world? \n\n|               | Water     | Storm         | Air           | Sand          | Fire       | Magma     | Earth      | Ice       |\n|           | Knowledge | Tempest       | Trickery      | Life       | Light      | War       | Nature     | Death     |\n|---------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|------------|-----------|------------|-----------|\n| **Knowledge** |         ? |\n| **Tempest**   | [Vondal]  |             ? |\n| **Trickery**  | [Ioun]    | [Brandobaris] |             ? |\n| **Life**      | [Sartus]^ | [Callie]      | [Avandra]     |          ?    |\n| **Light**     | [Moradin] | [Invictus]*   | [Tybalt]*     | [Pelor]       | [Hyperion] |\n| **War**       | [Erathis] | [Kord]        | (spider)      | [Bahamut]     | [Sune]     |         ? |\n| **Nature**    | [Bec]     | [Melora]      | [Sehanine]    | (cornucopia@) | [Corellon] | [Gruumsh] | [Gaia]     |\n| **Death**     | [Vecna]   | [Bram]        | [Oz]          | [Nerull]      | [Cal]      | [Tiamat]  | [Freki]    |         ? |\n\n^ = prone figure  \n\\* = darkened square  \n@ = scratched out  \n\\+ 8 mystery symbols on the diagonal\n\nWe spent quite some time figuring this out!\n\n| Eternals      | Elements         | Domains               |\n|---------------|------------------|-----------------------|\n| Corellon      | Fire + Earth     | Light + Nature        |\n| Avandra       | Sand + Air       | Life + Trickery       |\n| Erathis       | Magma + Water    | War + Knowledge       |\n| Ioun          | Air + Water      | Trickery + Knowledge  |\n| Moradin       | Water + Fire     | Knowledge + Light     |\n| Vecna         | Water + Ice      | Knowledge + Death     |\n| Brandobaris   |\n| Kord          | Magma            |\n| Melora        |\n| (spider)      | Magma + Air      | War + Trickery        |\n| Sehanine      |\n| Pelor         | Fire + Sand      | Light + Life          |\n| Bahamut       | Magma\n| (cornucopia@) | Earth + Sand     | Nature + Life         |\n| Nerull        | Sand + Ice       | Life + Death          |\n| Sune          | Magma            |\n| Gruumsh       |\n| Tiamat        |\n\n| Mortals       | Elements         | Domains               |\n|---------------|------------------|-----------------------|\n| Bec           | Water + Earth    | Knowledge + Nature    |\n| Cal           | Fire + Ice       | Light + Death         |\n| Callie        | Storm + Sand     | Tempest + Life        |\n| Freki         | Earth + Ice      | Nature + Death        |\n| Oz            | Air + Ice        | Trickery + Death      |\n| Vondal        | Water + Storm    | Knowledge + Tempest   |\n| Bram          | Storm + Ice      | \n| Sartus^       | Water + Sand     | \n| Tybalt*       | Air + Fire       | Trickery  + Light     |\n| Invictus*     | Fire + Storm     | Light + Tempest       |\n\n[Munin](../dossiers/munin) speaks to Freki and says he needs to activate the portal.\n\nOn the Nature/Nature square is a symbol representing the [Divine Mother Gaia](../dossiers/gaia), perhaps the source of all life:\n\n[![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5d/e1/79/5de17948ce8e608fd3ad5a606cdb9c34.jpg){:style=\"max-height:300px\"}](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/551761391846383889/)\n\nShe predates the [eternals](../creatures/eternals), according to legend. Cal recognizes the symbol as appearing once on a letter [his father](../dossiers/hyperion) got once. He mentions that his dad claimed that he \"used to be a god\" and talked about things he would do if he still had his full power.\n\nIt turns out that when we touch our own symbols, they light up, wow! But before we can activate the portal, Vondal and Cal leave to check out the basement. Down there are servant's quarters, more stairs leading down to the crypt, and a door with some evil-looking glyphs. Vondal thinks it looks like a lock of some kind.\n\nSomething floats out of the servant's quarters while Cal and Vondal are looking at the door. It's [a giant neck-head thing followed by a suit](../dossiers/roger). \"You won't get in there,\" he says helpfully.\n\n[![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4f/29/27/4f292710e7b577e4637622a351ebf9e5.jpg){:style=\"max-height:300px\"}](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/219339444324476393/)\n\n\"I believe the Master is expecting us,\" says Cal ominously.\n\n\"You do not possess the power of the Goddess of Secrets,\" says the servant (?).\n\nCal asks if they need that power to see the Master. The servant says you need it for the door, which may or may not lead to the Master, whatevs. \"This is Invictus's chamber, beyond which lies the Veil of Secrets.\"\n\nVondal recalls that one of the people who hired the SPI said the Veil of Secrets was the source of the problem. The butler opines that it doesn't matter whether they get it open or not, because nothing matters anymore. Vondal offers him a job, but he doesn't seem interested. He seems depressed. He should try taking a walk or writing a gratitude journal.\n\nCal wanders off while Vondal converses with the spirit. Eventually Vondal comes back and we all combine to activate the portal. \n\nThrough the portal is a mirror with a cloth on it. Vondal mentioned before that the butler said Invictus could see the future and sometimes the past, when he looked in the mirror. The edges of the room just fade away into nothing, as if we're always in the middle of the room no matter how far we walk.\n\nOz holds up the hornblade and uses it to cast light around. The room gets bigger, but there doesn't seem to be anyone or anything else there. Munin seemed veiled before but now seems clear. [Hugin](../dossiers/hugin) was clear before and is now veiled. Munin tells Freki to accept his destiny.\n\nVondal yanks the cover off the mirror and Munin is perched atop it! Munin says this is their domain, the domain of memory. Glancing at the mirror, Freki sees flames. Munin says the mirror shows what Freki has forgotten. \"This is where my parents died,\" Freki realizes. But he wasn't there when the village burned, so this can't be his memory.\n\nFreki sees himself go to confront the invaders and say in a voice that isn't his, \"What do you want?\" It's Freki's father's voice.

Bec leads the group teleportation ritual, barely competent (with Stephanie rolling exactly what was needed on the die). Anne Bonny provides the scroll of teleport. Callie draws the sigil sequence. Bec opts not to include the participants in the teleportation effect, but only the artifact.\n\nThe agents then realize they will need to trek back to Refuge&mdash;another seven-day journey through the desert, which has grown notably more inhospitable since the Cornucopia disappeared.\n\nAnne Bonny whines to her boss: \"Do we really need to slog all the way back?\" to which [Bram](../dossiers/bram-the-blithe) says no, they can teleport back. After a brief discussion, SPI agents agree to accompany Bram and Anne Bonny back to the [Tempest](../relics/tempest), Bram's ship.\n\nThey appear in the captain's quarters.

They left the scene with Freki and Ni, and made camp to decide what to do next. Ni decided to return to the scene after exchanging tokens in a binding agreement.\n2. A lizardfolk ninja named Semu appeared, and\u2014on strict orders from the elder of her tribe\u2014gave the SPI a \"voodoo compass\" capable of tracking the five tribes of the area. Semu warned it must be returned after justice had been served. The compass was flat\u2014the size of two hands together\u2014with four needles, the tail of each attached to something grisly:\n\n  * Manufeai: a fanged tooth\n  * Blood Hand Orcs: a patch of skin\n  * Malosi: a finger bone\n  * Stormherd: a clump of fur\n\n3. Semu said: \"Our debt to the Concord is now paid. When you are finished with the compass, leave it in Xaos, at the shrine of Essyllis. Do not seek us out or you will die. The elder also bid I give you this.\" She handed them a bag of fire beads. \"I warn you: her premonitions are incessant and melodramatic. Be measured in your response.\"\n4. Two beads emitted prophetic words:\n\n  * \"Beware: the poltergeist seeks to fulfill its wish.\"\n  * \"The death of the wilds brings the world's ruin. Unless you act.\"\n\n5. A third vibrated wildly, and when thrown in the fire, caused Vondal to materialize. And the fire snuffed out.\n6. The party used the compass to find the Malosi. It led them to a tree with a magical portal entrance. Freki used his bird [Hugin](../dossiers/hugin) to scout, but it was noticed by an orc dragon shaman, who vaporized with magical energy of some kind. Freki attacked in retaliation, and the dragon shaman blasted him too with devastatingly powerful but partially uncontrolled auras. Callie managed to talk down the situation with a bluff, leading to an uneasy truce.\n7. Andalla the shaman warned the party not to enter the portal (even though that's where the compass pointed), because inside was the Malosi chieftain Talos, who would likely kill them for trespassing.\n8. Andalla told the SPI that Kavaki's favorite place was down by the river, so they went there, and encountered another member of the Malosi: an armored being with a very large two-handed sword, standing watch. Attempts to check it for magical auras revealed it was a \"black hole\" of magic. Vondal's wild magic backfired, creating an explosive fireball, which nearly killed Callie\u2014but time slowed and a child emerged. She rubbed a substance over Callie's body and clothes, such that when the explosion resumed, Callie was not killed. \"You should be more careful,\" the girl said. The party soon learned her name was Sabrina.\n9. Sabrina was mischievous but friendly, and told them several important things:\n\n  * She is friends with Kavaki.\n  * Mengiris is her protector.\n  * Talos uses Sabrina's powers for his own purposes, when she allows it.\n  * She sculpts karach, which forms in underground caves where the Flux is strong.\n  * She made a karach weapon for Kavaki, who was very insistent about needing it for reasons Sabrina does not know.\n\n10. At the request of the SPI, Sabrina used her psychic ability to reach out to Kavaki. Bec created a [tiny hut](http://www.5esrd.com/spellcasting/all-spells/t/tiny-hut/), a magic bubble which would protect them from Sabrina's psychic disruption. Freki wanted no part of it, though, and was knocked unconscious by the mental force (think Professor X in the movie Logan). Mengiris was unaffected. Sabrina seemed substantially drained from the effort, saying she had done all she could. Shortly thereafter, Kavaki stumbled through the trees, having suffered grievous physical harm. \"It's gone,\" she muttered, and then collapsed in exhaustion.\n", "id": "events/case-06e03"}, {"title": "[11e02] Something Amiss at Rockwell Manor", "description": "Investigated the suspicious situation in the manor", "datestamp": "50-05-10/02", "when": "AC50 Rixa 10", "session-number": 38, "session-date": "2019-05-31", "session-event": "https://www.facebook.com/events/408443796644238/", "body": "1.

Freki smelled a strong unnatural smell in the kitchenette, and decided to leave. The smell permeated everything, but became less strong as he moved further away from the action.\n4. Back in the foyer, the party (sans Bec) discussed Auror's plan to protect the Cornucopia.\n\n  1. He will wall off the Cornucopia with walls of stone+force, and then *arcane lock* the door. The interior of the structure he builds is dimensionally anchored, alarmed and antilife shelled. Inside on the floor is a *glyph of warding* spell glyph with hold monster.\n  2. He tried to get Callie to sign off on the plan, warning that it would be expensive but worth it. He was reluctant to name a price; the party thought ~20-50K gp of materials alone.\n\n5. An undead \"courier\" of \"the Company\" arrived: a revenant with a contract signed by Lord Rockwell! He had a work order for one year of service from undead workers: 21 skeletons, 3 ghasts, and a revenant butler. Callie ordered them to wait outside until the issue could be cleared up by her father's return.\n6. Callie decided to send to her parents, one at a time:\n\n  a. [TO DAD] Undead platoon at the door, leader says they're yours. I sent them away. What's going on? Come home as soon as possible!\n  b. [RESPONSE] Oh, you made it home! So glad to hear! Yes, I hired them. Cost-saving measure, you know? Please let them in. Be home shortly.\n  c. [TO MOM] Where are you? Please tell me we still have live servants. Where is dad? Are you getting divorced? Come home as soon as possible!\n  d. [RESPONSE] \\*emotional voice\\* Callie? Where are you?? I'm coming to save you, honey! Stay strong, don't give in to the madness. I love you so much.\n\n8. Vondal appeared in the fountain. SPLASH! Then Pelor said into his head: \"YOU ARE NOT WORTHY OF THIS POWER. BEGONE AT ONCE.\" and he was flung from the fountain. Vondal was pissed! He spat into the fountain. The fountain shrugged it off.\n9. Callie poked her face out the front door and ordered the undead servants to make a path for when her parents got home.\n10. Oz heard a voice calling him \"My chosen avenger\" but that didn't make sense to him. He thought maybe it was a telepathic wrong number. But the voice persisted, and he saw that the Horn of the Cornucopia had become a compelling-looking hornblade. Oz decided to grapple over there swashbuckler-style.\n11. Freki started dancing to create a distraction. Oz landed on the top of the fountain and talked to a halfling ghost identifying herself as Yondalla. He touched the Cornucopia and his hand transformed! The Cornucopia itself lost its magical aura. Vondal theorized that the halfling woman was \"put outside of reality\" somehow.\n12. Callie's father returned home. He had a new tattoo of a white crane on his neck. He confirmed that he had hired the undead servants as a \"cost-saving measure\" and ordered them down into the manor to start working. A little while later, they heard Raliana scream.\n13. Bec realized that the revenant butler was her father, Letharil Galere. But he couldn't remember her.\n14. Raliana screamed. \"There are skeletons!\" and came upstairs. Callie calmed her down.\n15. People started having weirder and more intense ideas:\n\n  1. Freki wolfed out, trying to escape from the manor, but lost his direction.\n  2. Callie (at the suggestion of Raliana) got the big idea that her parents might be mentally incompetent, and\n\n16. People had a critical moment to reject the reality of what was transpiring, and state a revelation:\n\n  1. Vondal: \"This is the work of the deep ones!\"\n  2. Oz, reluctantly: \"This is not my hand!\" and it returned to normal. The Cornucopia was also back to normal.\n  3. Callie: \"That's not my dad!\" And Rollo said, \"What are you talking about?\" But his tattoo disappeared!\n  4. Bec was not sure what was real! Is it her dad?

A bat flies toward us. Those of us with dark vision can see it. [Oz](../dossiers/oz) takes the opportunity to hide under Malachai's corpse. He is truly the best of us.\n\nLuckily, our old buddy [Lestache](../dossiers/lestache-de-lyarcourt) flaps over in bat form and greets us. He's pretty surprised that we're all still alive. Also, he has a new accent. Never a dull moment!\n\n[Callie](../dossiers/callie) tries to remind everyone that [Mallory](../dossiers/mallory) told us we were to avoid unbalancing the powers here in [Arallu](../locales/arallu), but [Vondal](../dossiers/vondal) is here, so that goes nowhere.\n\nVondal explains that we found [the Lich](../dossiers/timor-invictus), but he wasn't exactly himself anymore. Lestache asks how Invictus came to be chained up in his own basement. Vondal explains that we think the [Necronomicon](../relics/necronomicon) was Invictus's phylactery. When the book was cleansed, it cleansed him too. So it's highly unlikely this could happen again.\n\nLestache is relieved that this is a one-time deal. He says \"some\" in his faction would want to seize power now that Invictus is gone. Not Lestache, though! He finds that tacky. He invites us to his \"chateau\" for dinner. I can't help noticing he didn't specify what's on the menu.\n\n[Bec](../dossiers/bec) tells him she thinks the effect is contained in [the manor](../locales/evershroud-manor), and also could he call us an Uber or something? When Lestache asks if there's anything else we need to do here, Vondal and Bec have a furious whisper fight over it. Vondal really wants Invictus destroyed, so he's stoked that Lestache seems like he could do it.\n\nNobody argues about the dinner invitation, so Lestache leaves to make arrangements. After a few minutes, a formation of five bats flies in. They all land and turn into vampires. The pommel of [Cal's sword](../relics/arkenstone) is glowing in their presence. They do not get too close to the manor, which is still shining.\n\nThe vampire who seems to be in charge, [Malak](../dossiers/malak-the-mad), responds to our questions with some riddle-like non-answers. This doesn't seem like a great start to our relationship. We ready for battle.\n\nOz comes out stabbin'! Then he walks away trying to be all cool or something.\n\nThe pincushion vampire bites Malachai's body. Its wounds heal from drinking Malachai's blood. Bec, an intellectual, knows that there are vampires and then vampire spawn. Spawn are lower ranking and more animalistic. She thinks most of this group are spawn.\n\nA vampire spawn attacks [Oz's monkey](../dossiers/monkey) and grievously wounds it! The monkey turns back into a statue and clatters to the ground.\n\nMalak takes a sack off her back and turns it inside-out. A bunch of things falls out, including a buttload of ghouls and ghasts! \"Oh, right, that's what was in there,\" says Malak. She directs the undead mob at me. Hey, I'm too cute to get eaten alive!\n\nThere are so many creatures they can't all reach me, so some of them attack [Cal](../dossiers/cal). This is quite an onslaught, but Cal is great at resisting this kind of thing. Unlike me; I am not great at resisting. I get paralyzed. At least I'm not dead, thanks to Vondal.\n\nCal, having been attacked, is enraged. I mean, I am too, but I can't do anything about it. He ends up taking one out.\n\nTwo ghasts attack [Murky](../dossiers/vondal#murky), and one attacks Vondal.\n\nA vampire in a white dress leaps elegantly at Bec and grapples her in preparation for taking a big ol' bite. Well, as long as they keep it classy.\n\nOz tries to hide behind [Freki](../dossiers/freki). He gets partial cover from that. Freki will need double movement to get off that square, since Ozborn is underfoot. DM: \"He's not literally between your legs.\" Nate: \"Respectfully disagree.\"\n\nBec casts *fire shield*.\n\nCallie casts *bless* at level 4 to bless everybody in our party. Callie also gets attacked for 10 HP.\n\nIn response to being attacked, Freki feels like clawing it. Huh, what a weird thing to think. He reaches for his sword, but that feels...like, wrong somehow? He attacks with his bow.\n\nVondal puts a hand on Callie's shoulder and teleports them both away, back inside the manor, with a swoosh of his cape.\n\nMurky tries to pick up the monkey statue. It's a little too heavy, so Murky log-rolls it toward the manor. This attracts the attention of some of the enemies, who kill Murky. RIP, little buddy, it was a good try.\n\nThe red vampire moves into the spot vacated by Callie and attacks Bec. The fire shield burnsssss it preciousssssss. Nice!\n\nOz stabs to his left. That vamp is looking pretty raggedy, but it's not quite done for.\n\nMalak points at Oz and says, \"You're naughty.\" He somehow manages to pull out enough wisdom to resist. Malak declares Bec naughty next. She resists too. \"You're ESPECIALLY naughty!\" she says to Cal. With Vondal and Callie's assorted blessings, he also resists. Stuff's still attacking him, though, so he takes damage.\n\nCal attacks. His sword explodes with radiant light and hits a bunch of the undeads. He defeats one of the vampires, which turns into mist and starts retreating. He destroys a couple of the ghouls/ghasts.\n\nMalak looks at Callie through the window of the manor and says, \"Peekaboo!\" SHE SEES ME! I deflect her mind-magic, though.\n\nA vampire attacks Bec and gets burned, haha.\n\nCallie continues concentrating on *bless*, but also blows up the mist vampire with *sacred flame*, then hits Malak with *spiritual weapon* (level 3). The ol' one-two! Hiyah, have at you! Not really though, stop running at me, I'm very uncomfortable!\n\nFreki attacks and does some damage.\n\nVondal uses his Wand of Wonder, so as not to ignite the [Flux](../locales/flux) that this manor is full of. He casts *gust of wind* in Malak's general direction. The window in front of us blows out. The monkey statue blows away. Oh man, Oz is never gonna find that thing.\n\nA vampire grapples Freki, bites him, and drains some of his blood. It awakens the beast within Freki. He can choose to resist or accept it. It feels good and right! But is it the vampire trying to turn him? It doesn't matter, he can't control it....\n\nHE'S A WOOOOOOOOOOLF!\n", "id": "events/case-14e05"}, {"title": "[13e01] Flimflam in the Forest", "description": "TODO", "datestamp": "50-05-30/01", "when": "AC50 Auran Apex", "session-number": 58, "session-date": "2023-01-21", "session-event": "https://www.facebook.com/events/726888512091068/", "body": "The SPI is on the trail of a suspected [doppelganger](../creatures/changelings), the spitting image of [one of their former colleagues](../dossiers/sima).\n\n\n\n[Cal](../dossiers/cal) asks the elves if they can do a locator spell for his sword... but can't remember the result...\n\nAt camp the first night, [Freki](../dossiers/freki) confronts Cal about his behavior, and they bury the hatchet.\n\n[Callie](../dossiers/callie) casts a *sending* to [Enoki](../dossiers/enoki) to make sure he is doing OK.

Freki declines to be magicked.\n\nFreki feels he is somehow connected to whatever is following them.\n\n[Hugin](../dossiers/hugin): \"Indeed, there is a connection.\"  \n[Munin](../dossiers/munin): \"Yes... It is me. I remember... dying.\"  \nMunin: \"I am me. The other... a facsimile only.

The choice is yours.\"  \n\nFreki remembers that he did see Munin die once. He later had a [vision](case-06e05) of [the dragon shaman that killed Munin](../dossiers/andalla) turning into a raven and flying away.\n\nFreki: \"Something is following me. I don't think it's following *us*, it's following *me*. So... do we want to as a group book it after Sima? Do we want me to run ahead possibly taking the thing that's following me with me? And you guys follow it best you can? I might be able to catch Sima. I have no idea what happens if I catch Sima when it catches me.\"\n\nBec: \"But if you go and it chases you, at some point it will have to pass by us.\"\n\nFreki proposes that the agents stay together, and move at a speed that allows everyone to stay alert. (\"I can't have flippy McGee flippin'!\")\n\nFreki: \"Our priority is no longer catching Sima, it's staying together.\"\n\nFreki is trying to guard his thoughts, in case the third raven can perceive them.\n\nThe agents abandon their tree-lurking plan, because Freki can tell the third raven is not getting closer while they are stopped.\n\nThey start moving again. They can see ahead no more than 100-200 feet, due to all the trees.\n\nFreki feels like bird #3 is maybe a half-mile to the southeast, and keeping its distance.\n\nFreki sprints 100 yards ahead, to check whether the bird keeps pace with him. It does. Does it think that's funny? He senses that it is amused by his behavior. Arrogant!\n\n\n\nOz: \"Can you untree me?\"  \nCallie: \"Ohh... I dunno...... can you give me one of those candy bars you've been hoarding?\"  \nNate: \"How did you know that Oz invented nougat in this world?\"\n\n-----------\n\nThe agents think back on what happened during their first few days of pursuit...\n\nOne the first night: Oz sneaks up to the camp, sees Sima doing normal camp things, including building a fire, hunting, and fletching. She has only the clothes on her back, but is a competent survivalist. He also sees some of Sima's skin on her hand slough off while she is eating dinner, and she cries out in pain.\n\nSecond night: Oz sneaks up to the camp again, and sees Sima casting a spell on a small thrush bird. It flies up to her and lands in her hand. She whispers something to it, and sends it flying off ahead. Oz thinks she enchanted it to do something. He also sees her casting *goodberry* on some berries and eating one of them.\n\nBec drips antitoxen onto [Isis](../dossiers/isis-raksh)'s blood. It distends and reacts. Same even more so when Bec tries mixing more water with the blood: it's like it can't hold one shape while confronted with another liquid.\n\nCallie casts *speak with dead* on Isis. Oz, because he killed Isis, is banished to a ways away before doing it, so that the corpse does not clam up in response to an enemy being present. After consulting with her team, Callie asks these questions: \n\n1. What is your mission? *To protect the world from another Vanishing.*\n\n2. Where do you come from? *[Alye'adu](../locales/alyeadu).* (Bec translates this word from elven as something like \"together double\".)\n\n3.

Callie tries to talk her down and gives her a little information about the puzzlebox. Seirye is unhappy that people don't believe her.\n\nOn the second night, Meroe is doing worse. Her affliction resembles mummy rot (but isn't), also resembles turning into undead (but isn't that either).\n\nOn night four, Meroe throws up dead bees.\n\nOn the fifth night, Meroe can hardly go any farther. Freki decides to leave and see if he can retrieve the water. Meroe confesses to the circus crime. She framed Zombozo for the murder because he killed her parents when she was 13 (also he sucked as a manager, but mainly the parents thing). Also, after Freki leaves, Panthea rips out a chunk of her hair and it turns into Oz. Seirye beats the hair with her quarterstaff as it turns into our party member.\n\nThen, a worm! Right after supper the worm attacks and is strangely attracted to Meroe but the party (with Freki hurriedly returning from his scouting ahead) manages to kill it before it can harm anyone.\n\nOn day six, Seirye tries to convince us to go through with the heist. When we won't agree, activates her bracelet of friends, and summons her pirate boss, Bram the Blithe! We learn that Seirye is really Anne \"Bonny\" Qin, Seirye's sister, and notorious first mate of the dreadnought Tempest. The time travel schtick was a ruse. But Anne and Bram insist that the goddess Melora really did tell them that a great calamity is coming, and the artifacts need to be secured. In any case, we agree to continue to the Cornucopia in order to heal Meroe and Panthea.\n\nOn day seven, Meroe is comatose, so we pull her in a makeshift sled.\n\nWe arrive at the Cornucopia. There are two Luminous Defender paladins there, two weeks off schedule! Meroe has awoken, and is acting strange, claiming she is fine. She meanders toward the paladins. As she reaches the Cornucopia to take a drink, one of the paladin tries to put his hand on her shoulder: \"Halt! Who are you?

We need to know how far this goes.\"\n\nSartus explains that he needs the hand anyway, because it will improve their chance of success at unmaking the words from the [Book of the Dead](../relics/necronomicon).\n\nBec: \"We need to tell people. [Tybalt](../dossiers/tybalt).\"\n\nSartus: \"Do we?\"\n\nCallie: \"We may need to find a way to know that we are all who we are.\"\n\nOz (bluffing): \"It's well known in the circles I travel in, that doppelgangers are real. And we have a very simple test.\" He pulls a vial out of my pack, with liquid in it. Unbeknownst to everyone, it's just water. He pricks his finger, puts some blood in, and explains that if he were a doppelganger, it would have fizzed and reacted.\n\nCal immediately pricks his finger and proves he's not a doppelganger.\n\nIn actuality, Oz wants to test who will refuse to do the test. Everyone except Freki agrees to do the test, and \"passes\" it.\n\nPhoebe suggests that the test actually works, and that any liquid will do, which gives Oz momentary pause.\n\n\n\nPhoebe looks at Sartus and asks him whether he really wants to proceed with his plan. Sartus answers earnestly that he does, and Phoebe agrees to help him. The exchange seems uncomfortably intense.\n\nThe party votes on what to do next:\n\n* Cal wants to seek out Tybalt because he wants to investigate whether [Sima](../dossiers/sima) is another doppelganger.\n* Sartus wants to *not* tell Tybalt, and instead steal the Book first.\n* Callie votes to deal with the Book first.\n* Freki wants to go after the safe, because he would like to stick to some plan for more than 20 seconds.\n* Bec would also like to go after the Book.\n* Oz is also on board with that.\n\nCal argues that we outnumber Tybalt, and should find him first.\n\nCallie expresses concern that Tybalt also could be a doppelganger.\n\nBec: \"I think we really need to save the [Tree](../relics/yggdrasil).\"\n\nCallie suggests using a [*sending*](https://5e.tools/spells.html#sending_phb) to Tybalt. She thinks the risk is low that it get intercepted by a false/doppel version of Tybalt&mdash;that it will likely go to the Tybalt they have been interacting with.\n\nThe agents discuss this idea, but Sartus suggests to be very careful what they say to him.\n\n\n\nCal: \"If you guys don't want to go there, we should at least warn him.\"\n\nOz: \"But if he *is* one, we're in deep doo-doo. And let's face facts: he probably is.\"\n\nSartus pleads with Cal, arguing that if Tybalt has any whiff that they are going after the Book, he will try to stop them.\n\nCal agrees on two conditions:\n\n1. As soon as we're done, we go to Tybalt.\n2. We destroy that book immediately.\n\nSartus agrees completely, but expresses doubt that the book can be easily destroyed. Cal thinks: \"I wish I had my fuckin' sword...\"\n\nThey decide not to cast *sending*, and go straight to the vault. It's an hour's walk through the city, from the ground floor on up through the city's various districts of lowtown, midtown, hightown, and finally the palace:\n\n[![Estanesse lowtown](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/50/1a/60/501a607d9ad6aae8fc55857413c46556.jpg){:style=\"max-width: 300px\"}](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/182466222394582881/) [![Estanesse midtown](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d3/04/b9/d304b9ef45f7251ebada4985721faa06.png){:style=\"max-width: 300px\"}](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/595812225684411951/) [![Estanesse hightown](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/35/c5/2b/35c52bcd6d560f4a6196544a293055da.jpg){:style=\"max-width: 300px\"}](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/844776842620971109/) [![Estanesse palace](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/77/c2/70/77c2701ad299681672e27c557b323af4.jpg){:style=\"max-width: 300px\"}](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/5277724555033748/)\n\nThey reach the treasury building, situated on a tree branch such that there is only one accessible entrance and exit. The entryway has a high vaulted ceiling with a walkway of quite some length, beyond which is the treasure room proper, protected by several elite elven guards.\n\n[![Estanesse palace treasury exterior](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/87/31/de/8731de778fd477cc4f3283effec3f80c.png){:style=\"max-width: 300px\"}](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/515591857352151979/)\n[![Estanesse palace treasury entryway](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bc/6e/c2/bc6ec292572e527c28adafbd19c3f7c0.jpg){:style=\"max-width: 300px\"}](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/145522631701247945/)\n\nAt the building's entrance, a figure stands with his back turned.

Freki was backhandedly blessed by Pelor, and could breathe either water or air.\n3. Rollo argued that the party should take the Cornucopia with them on a mission to locate the evil entities' lair, destroy them, and save his wife Linistreya.\n4. The group discussed how best to take the artifact out of the city and move on the lair of the big bad evil fish. They decided to speak to the city council, presenting themselves as agents of Linistreya, and request support.\n5. Freki (reluctantly) opened his mind to Pelor, and felt a slight connection: \"THE FUTURE IS YOURS TO SHAPE.\"\n6. Callie prayed to her deities for guidance: \"Should we take the cornucopia, in whole or in part, out of Cognitutus; or should we leave it in the city where it is protected?\" Her deities replied, \"The fissures in your reality grow deeper... and time is a horizon beyond which even we gods see only imperfectly. Erathis: Take the Fountain, and all we have built may begin to topple and be destroyed. Avandra: Take the Fountain, and you may emerge triumphant over malevolent forces from before the dawn of time.\"\n7. The water smelled funny.\n8. Oz scaled the Cornucopia and retrieved the horn, which became the Hornblade once he allowed the mysterious (and possibly malevolent) halfling spirit to touch him. The Hornblade functions as a +3 short sword of [sharpness](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/magic-items/magic-armor-and-weapons/#Sword_of_Sharpness) and [wounding](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/magic-items/magic-armor-and-weapons/#Sword_of_Wounding).\n9. Gonna go talk to the Board of Regents! \"Jeeves: to the Hall of Regents.\"\n10. Sirens started going off. Callie knew that this meant the fish army was already attacking.\n11. Guards tried to keep the party out of the meeting, but they persuaded their way in by dropping Callie's mom's name.\n12. Rollo attempted to speak to the Regents, but he is not a political creature and did not give a good speech.\n13. Callie gave a speech: \"We are aware of the threat to the city. My mother went on a mission to save it and she needs our help. I was granted a divine vision from Avandra. When you have an invasive plant, you do not just cut off the top and hope for the best. You dig it out root and stem! We are willing to lay down our lives for Cognitutus, what are you willing to do?\"\n14. Freki gave a speech: \"I'm just a simple amphibious wolfman archer and I am willing to stand not only behind but in front of Callie to help.\"\n15. Oz gave a speech: \"We are the SPI and this is what we do - we get results! The front line is not where you think it is.\" He also stole a chicken drumstick as a prop/snack and wielded it to great effect.\n16. After some deliberation, one of the regents (Kwalish) agreed to loan them her minisub called the Streamcutter, and one of the others (Aurora) agreed to come along on the crazy mission. The minisub also has a scout ship called the Crab that can be piloted by two gnome-sized people. The top can be put down like a convertible, although water will flood it unless a wizard can provide a diving bell sort of effect. There are 3 Caps of Water Breathing. It also has a button that will automatically teleport the sub back home, but it can only be used once. She also has an experimental module that might allow the sub to pass through a wall\u2014or else scramble the sub and everyone on it.\n17. Rollo went back to Rockwell manor to pick up some of his alchemical creations. He brought back 10 [oils of slipperiness](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/magic-items/potions-oils/#Oil_of_Slipperiness).\n18. The party then met up with Aurora near the west gate, with guns on hand. It was clear the city's alarms were going off in that area; curfew had been imposed. Attack seemed imminent.\n", "id": "events/case-11e04"}, {"title": "[12e07] Dickery in the Hickory", "description": "Talked to Eixam, met the hamadryad, reached the illusory Fruit", "datestamp": "50-05-25/07", "when": "AC50 Rixa 25", "session-number": 52, "session-date": "2022-09-03", "session-event": "https://www.facebook.com/events/3098841137000207/", "image-heart": "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/db/6a/eb/db6aeb6a09364184dbb3deb9cb4566ed.png", "image-heart-source": "https://www.pinterest.com/pin/heart-of-the-forest-by-jkroots-on-deviantart--551409548100086588/", "body": "[Eixam](../dossiers/eixam) claims they want to help stop the destruction of the Tree (*GM's note: \"they\" is Eixam's pronoun*), and says that the party's current means of travel will take too long to reach the Fruit. They offer to take the party there more quickly.\n\nThe party is cautiously interested in learning more about Eixam's proposal, although they can sense that Eixam is full of malice. Eixam suggest a convoluted plan to travel via getting into a portable hole, which is an extradimensional space that can be folded up and carried by Eixam, who will fly directly to the Fruit.\n\nUnfortunately, [Enoki](../dossiers/enoki) *hates* Eixam because locusts eat his mushroom pals. \"They insatiably devour whole fields. Out of balance.\" He flat refuses to go with Eixam. So the SPI agents decline Eixam's help, who buzzes off.\n\nEnoki offers to carry them in the portable hole instead, after chastising them for not telling him about it before.\n\nThe party's plan: [Callie](../dossiers/callie) will levitate using her tattoo and be pulled by [Cal](../dossiers/cal), who along with [Oz](../dossiers/oz) will be carried by Oz's mysterious new winged monkey companion. [Sartus](../dossiers/sartus-morningdew) will cast *fly* and keep pace, carrying the folded up portable hole. The remaining members will enter the portable hole and ride inside.\n\n[Bec](../dossiers/bec) casts rope trick inside the portable hole, so they have 1 hour of air. Then [Freki](../dossiers/freki), [Vondal](../dossiers/vondal), and Murky also climb into the hole-inside-a-hole. Unfortunately, Freki's discomfort with magic causes him to panic when he gets in the hole; Freki wolfs out and tries to escape, but the hole is rather deep. Vondal cleverly casts *banishment* on Freki to boot him from the extradimensional space, and Callie calms emotions.\n\nCallie begins levitating, towed by Freki, who is now flying thanks to another *fly* spell from Sartus.\n\nFor the first 20 minutes, the monkey struggles to carry both Oz and Cal at the same time. But then out of nowhere, she grows *huge divine wings*! Oz has vision of a woman in a dark cloak, face down, turning... on the other side, a red-haired woman in a green and yellow dress:\n\n[![](https://ghwiki.greyparticle.com/images/4/46/Yondalla.jpg)](https://ghwiki.greyparticle.com/index.php/File:Yondalla.jpg)\n\nThe next ten minutes are easier going, although the agents hear continual buzzing in the distance, and surmise that Eixam must be shadowing them. Freki's ravens confirm this fact.\n\nThen Cal receives a *sending* from [Tybalt](../dossiers/tybalt):\n\n* **Tybalt:** Found druid's lair. Yaara'tal [Yggdrasil](../relics/yggdrasil) cave near elderly [tree-melded](../creatures/tree-melded). [Sima](../dossiers/sima) dead, chained inside. Other Sima captured. Infected [Queen](../dossiers/ambriel-estanesse) awakening, spells doom. Hurry!\n* **Cal**: Holy crap. Enoki leading us to Fruit. 30 minutes away. Eixam, locust thing, hovering nearby. Friend or foe? Two Simas?\n\nAnother *sending* follows shortly thereafter:\n\n* **Tybalt:** Heard of a creature of vermin, evil being. Be wary. Glad but surprised Enoki helps. Yes two Simas, one must be imposter. Will find out.\n* **Cal:** Will update as soon as something changes.\n\nSoon, the party reaches a place where there is a thick mist around a large branch of the Tree. The party has a sense that something of import is happening, as the mist parts and a regal tree-like creature emerges from the tree trunk:\n\n[![](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/3d/f0/5c/3df05c2b56886d9caf8dd5f895b10b4c.jpg)](../dossiers/phoebe)\n\nSome agents identify her as a creature called a [hamadryad](../creatures/dryads#hamadryads), a powerful dryad bonded not to a single tree, but rather an entire forest.\n\nEnoki recognizes this woman and, bowing respectfully, says, \"Your Grace? What are you doing here?\"\n\nCal recognizes her too, and refers to her as [Phoebe](../dossiers/phoebe). But he seems surprised that she does not appear to recognize him in return. Cal asks her directly if she knows [Hyperion](../dossiers/hyperion). Callie recalls that Hyperion is the name of a [titan](../creatures/titans). After some short exchanges, Phoebe confesses that the Tree's sickness is affecting her mind, and she is having trouble with her memory.\n\nEixam buzzes over, radiating even more fury and hatred than usual. They tell the hamadryad she shouldn't be here. Bec asks immediately why not; Eixam responds with a lie: \"Because it is not safe.\"\n\n\"I can take you directly to the Fruit of Life,\" she responds, \"There is not much time left.\" She explains that her ability to *tree stride* can take others along with her, as long as everyone links hands. After a short discussion, the agents accept her aid.\n\nPhoebe takes everyone, including Eixam, through the tree trunk to a very beautiful place. They see the Fruit they've been looking for!\n\n[![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/db/6a/eb/db6aeb6a09364184dbb3deb9cb4566ed.png){:style=\"width:400px\"}](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/551409548100086588/)\n\nUnfortunately, it's way too big to put in the portable hole or otherwise transport.\n\nBec and Sartus warn the party that there is a powerful illusion magic happening. Eixam agrees, \"Yes, this is wrong.\"\n\nNonetheless, Phoebe starts walking toward the fruit, transfixed.\n\nSartus says, \"Your Grace, it is not real.\" But she keeps walking.\n\nVondal casts *wall of fire* between Phoebe and the fruit.\n\nThe fire burns away the mist and the glamour with it. The mist flows into Vondal's mouth. Beyond the glamour, the Tree ends. If Phoebe had kept walking, she would have fallen off it. She snaps out of her trance.\n\nConfused, she says, \"But I brought us to the fruit. We are here, at the heart of it.\"\n\nBec asks Eixam whether that's true. \"Perhaps,\" they answer.\n\nEnoki scouts and then reports, \"There, I see it! That way!\"\n\nThe party follows where he's pointing. It looks like a dead end&mdash;like he's flying through the trunk. Another illusion?\n\nFreki goes through it and sees the true heart in the distance, surrounded by a huge amount of thorns. He (and he alone&mdash;the rest of the party is still on the other side of the illusory border) hears Enoki cry out in fear, and sees the poor little guy trapped in the huge thicket of thorns, which supernaturally surge toward the party!\n", "id": "events/case-12e07"}, {"title": "[15e00] Bonding with Bilbo", "description": "TODO", "datestamp": "50-06-04/00b", "when": "AC50 Vis 03", "session-number": 68, "session-date": "2024-02-17", "session-event": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1088613419043899/", "body": "## Callie's Journal\n\nNone of us knew [Freki](../dossiers/freki) was a [werewolf](../creatures/lycans), but I guess getting bitten is the kind of thing that could trigger the transformation. We'll have to figure out how to calm him down without hurting him too much.\n\nWe're in combat! The [undead](../creatures/undead) leaders are fleeing while we make coleslaw out of the minions.\n\n[Bec](../dossiers/bec) sees a bat and is inspired to whack it with her bat (mace, but who's counting?). She ends up smacking it straight into [Cal](../dossiers/cal), where it bounces off his abs and falls to the ground.\n\nCal picks up a petrified creature and swings it around, hitting five of eight of the undeads surrounding him. He lets it fly! Man, this is exciting! What if we gathered athletes every year to compete against each other at throwing petrified zombies?\n\n[Vondal](../dossiers/vondal) uses the [Wand of Wonder](../dossiers/vondal#magic-items) at the mist. His hair stands on end, bursts into flame, gets sucked into his body, and shoots out the wand as a fireball! Somehow this also entails shooting [Roger](../dossiers/roger) (the servant from the basement of the mansion) out the wand. He winds up sort of inside one of the mist creatures? Look, this has been a really weird day.\n\nA massive fireball washes over everything on the field of battle. Hmm, this would be another good event for my new sporting venture. I could sell a *ton* of snacks.\n\nBec runs over and yells at me to help calm Freki down. I promise that I will as soon as I can.\n\nRoger reaches out a spectral...tentacle...and pats Freki on the shoulder because he's looking unwell.\n\nFreki is creeped out and attacks him! He says, \"Owww... I can't hold on forever, you know.\"\n\nAll of the hostile undeads seem like they're neutralized or fleeing, so I drop the *bless* spell and cast *calm emotions* to hit Freki.\n\nFreki feels very calm, and thinks that he always knew about the beast inside, even though he was surprised earlier. He has gained a deeper understanding of [his wolf nature](../rules/lycan-ranger). And his bird friends are back!\n\n[Munin](../dossiers/munin): \"I remember now. All is as it should be again.\"  \n[Hugin](../dossiers/hugin): \"[Vecna](../dossiers/vecna)'s hold over us has been broken.\"\n\n[Oz](../dossiers/oz) wonders how long he's been a wolf. Freki says he's always been that way, so it's probably the [Flux](../locales/flux) making us forget. He says he comes from a village of Lycanthropes and [Talos](../dossiers/talos) killed his father.\n\nThere is a twinkling in the distance, and as it grows closer, someone is waving. \"Hello! Don't shoot! Hello there! [M'lord Lestache](../dossiers/lestache-de-lyarcourt) sent me! I mean no harm!\"\n\nIt's a [halfling](../creatures/halflings) on a flying carpet, flanked by bats. He lands the carpet, and the bats transform into [vampires](../creatures/vampires), who stand there wordless. They look like bodyguards.\n\n\"I came from [the chateau](../locales/chateau-de-mecant). M'lord sent me to invite you to his grand ball tonight,\" says the halfling.\n\nBec explains that we were attacked by another group of vampires after Lestache left. Oz asks the halfling (in halfling language) if he saw the wolf and points at Freki.\n\nThe halfling is impressed, but he doesn't know anything about werewolves. Bec tells him that [Malak](../dossiers/malak-the-mad) got away. Oz complains about the fireball, not knowing Vondal is the one who cast it. The halfling extends this offer to us: if we attend the ball, we have Lestache's word that we'll be safe before and after the event. That makes me ask, not during? He rattles off a list of calamities that Lestache promises will not befall us: we will remain alive, unharmed, unturned, unbitten, not food for Lestache or any of his kind. Also, we get to stay in the halfling's house. Freki asks him if he's ever heard of a union, and suggests he find some other familiars for collective bargaining purposes.\n\nOur guide, [Bilbo](../dossiers/bilbo), gives us a little flying carpet tour of [Sepulchris](../locales/sepulchralis), the underground vampire city. He points out \"Malak the Mad's\" place. Bec asks how Malak knew where we were, and Bilbo answers that he \"couldn't say\" (um, sir) but Malak is known to have prophetic visions sometimes. He points out another enormous castle-looking residence belonging to \"[Enoch the Wise](../dossiers/enoch-the-wise)\" and suggests not to go there, saying the Ventru are known to be ruthless&mdash;but then everyone is here. He sounds pretty over it. I ask him how he came to be Lestache's familiar. He says he won't tell the story for anything less than three pints of beer. Noted!\n\nOz decides to put the Panache on Bilbo. Now they're temporary besties! He tells Oz that his home is guaranteed safe from vampires. The whole thing is ringed with garlic and there are stained glass windows with images of ravens: circling above a field of corpses, pecking out an eye. There's a figure in a cloak. I recognize these as related to [Nerull](../dossiers/nerull).\n\nBilbo welcomes us in and goes to make tea. When the door closes, he breathes a sigh of relief. He points out a talisman of Nerull. Every door and window has a talisman. He warns us not to remove the talismans or open the doors or windows for anybody. Vampires can't come in without an invitation. Oz asks him again what his deal is. He says \"I love it here!!!!!\" in a weird way that doesn't seem one hundred percent genuine. \"I'm treated well and have more freedom compared to other familiars. They tend to get eaten fairly quickly in these parts. My master knows this, and allows me these protections and creature comforts to help keep me safe.\"\n\nBilbo toasts \"to the living&mdash;may we all stay that way!\" and offers us ale and tea. Freki asks if he has family, and toasts them. He asks why Freki is so calm, and Freki says he has good friends. (\u2044 \u2044\u2022\u2044\u03c9\u2044\u2022\u2044 \u2044) Freki was a lone wolf, but he was looking for a reason to join a team. He joined for me, awwwww. Bec says her mother died and [her father](../dossiers/letharil-galere) disappeared, so she joined [the SPI](../orgs/spi) to find him.\n\n\"What's the SPI?\" asks Bilbo.\n\n\"How does this guy not know the SPI?\" Oz asks in response.\n\n\"He lives under a rock,\" I point out. Well, it's true!\n\nFreki asks what Cal's deal is. Explain yourself, shortie! Being a little drunk, Bilbo spills that he thinks he might recognize Cal. Is he from the Ranch? Cal doesn't know that name. Bilbo is astonished to hear that he might be from the surface?! They agree that the surface [Arallu](../locales/arallu) is real, real bad (but pls don't tell Lestache that Bilbo said so).\n\nBilbo proposes a game. Question for a question! He asks Vondal what's his favorite color? Orange!\n\nVondal asks Oz for a list of all the languages he speaks. Oz answers in thieves cant.\n\nOz asks Bilbo how he came to be Lestache's servant. Bilbo answers that he was fleeing vampires with a companion. The companion got eaten, but Lestache needed a new familiar to replace the one Malak ate. He asks Cal what it's like on the surface. Cal says he spent a lot of time on [glaciers](../locales/glacier) and it toughened him up. Bilbo protests that it's not enough of the truth, so he has to drink.\n\nCal takes a drink and asks, \"How often does your master meet with the Triumvirate?\"\n\nBilbo answers that he only meets with the [Lord Brucolac](../dossiers/cronus), as all the clan leaders do from time to time. The Brucolac probably won't be at the party, as such things are beneath him, but most of the clan heads should be there. Cal asks Bilbo where the Brucolac lives, and Bilbo says no one knows: he appears and disappears as he wishes. But you can always tell when he's about to appear because everything grows dark and cold.\n\nBilbo asks Freki which of his friends annoys him most, LOL. Freki answers that his first journal entry was a note to kill Vondal in revenge for trying to kill Hugin and Munin. Also, Freki resents magic and the whole wild magic thing just skeeves him out. But then again, why can't Oz tell the truth about something as simple as how many languages he speaks?!\n\nBilbo asks (out of turn) if this is Vondal's real form? What in the world kind of creature *is* he, anyway? Has he ever had eyestalks? I say he's a wild mage and not even trustworthy to himself. Bilbo asks Freki what Oz's deal is. Freki says Oz is such an agent of chaos he doesn't even know if Oz is on our side half the time. Cal says chaos can breed the end of chaos. Bilbo likes that logic. So Cal is a mastermind, channeling all of our chaotic personalities, is what Bilbo is getting out of this.\n\nFreki asks why the spellcasters don't guide the party more. Bec says she deliberates carefully. Bilbo says I, [Callie](../dossiers/callie), am wise and therefore avoid doing dumb things. This guy gets it! I use *thaumaturgy* to make a little halo of light appear above my head, but Vondal calls me on it, the bastard.\n\nWe're really cool with this guy, so Vondal and Cal float the idea that Bilbo could go with us. Bilbo says his master needs him here. His eye twitches; Cal infers that he is under the influence of magical charm.\n\nIt's Vondal's turn, so he asks Bec if he looked good as a pony. Bec says yes, he wore it well. Then she asks him how old he is. Vondal says his consciousness is 87 or so. Oz says he trusts little about Vondal, like that time he put armor on [an owlbear](../dossiers/rain). \"THAT OWLBEAR IS ONE OF THE BEST AGENTS WE HAVE,\" says Vondal.\n\n\"Well, I believe that,\" says Oz.\n\n\"How did [the SPI](../locales/spi-hq) get destroyed?\" Bec asks Vondal.\n\n\"Mistakes were made,\" says Vondal.\n\nAnswer the question, dammit! Vondal \"explains\" that he woke up in a dumpster and his meat suit was younger than it was before then, but his mind is still the same. The [God of Dwarves](../dossiers/moradin) came. He is very reluctant to talk about it, very unlike him.\n\nBilbo is like, \"Oh, it's his fault! He did something bad and doesn't want to talk about it!\"\n\nVondal admits that \"Experiments were being run...on [the thing that made the SPI blow up](../relics/arkenstone).\"\n\n\"So the SPI blowing up, that was you?\" Bec asks.\n\n\"No, it wasn't me.\"\n\n\"You were involved?\"\n\n\"I was there.\"\n\n\"You were indirectly involved?\"\n\n\"Listen, girlie! I've had a paper published! I know what words mean!\"\n\nOz, incensed by Vondal's sexism, bounces his mug off Vondal's head.\n\nBut anyway, Vondal explains that [it was an accident](../events/spi-fire). He was experimenting, and the god showed up, and then the dumpster. The course of events is clear!\n\n\"Did that bring the Flux here?\" Bec asks.\n\n\"Nooooooo,\" says Vondal.\n\n\"Then why is there Flux at all, and can we put it back?\" Freki asks.\n\n\"It's not your turn!\" Vondal protests.\n\n\"I'd like to know that,\" says Bilbo.\n\nBut Vondal wants to know if Cal is undead. Cal hates undead! But Freki hates magic but also is a magic, so the two things really aren't mutually exclusive. Freki says that he is NOT magic, thankyouverymuch.\n\nBilbo asks if Cal has plans to kill Lestache. Vondal says we have no current plans. Bilbo says he'd be most distressed if Lestache were killed (\\*twitch\\*twitch\\*). And if the Brucolac were killed, everyone in [Xaryuvia](../locales/xaryuvia) would be even more miserable than they already are. What's that? His hometown. He asks if we've heard the name \"Xaryu.\" Some of us recognize it as [an infamous crimelord](../dossiers/xaryu) from [the Radiant Union of Pelor](../locales/rup). He's a [beholder](../creatures/beholders) and also there's a cult that worships him. Back in my very first case, we saw a [Colosseum](../locales/beastly-colosseum) that was rumored to be backed financially by Xaryu. Bilbo used to be&mdash;and most of his people still are&mdash;in the thrall of Xaryu. He complains that he used to be a law-abiding cleric of [Tiamat](../dossiers/tiamat), but then he was banished from the colony and hunted by vampires. We're kind of getting into the idea of liberating Bilbo's family.\n\n\"Do you know the first thing about beholders?\" asks Bilbo.\n\n\"Do they know the first thing about *us*?\" asks Freki.\n\nThey're aberrations, unnatural. They shouldn't even be here. They're covered in eyes, which makes it extremely hard to sneak up on them. In their lairs, it's completely impossible. Beholders shoot petrification rays, but they do need a target or an inkling that there's a threat. They're also extremely intelligent, good at planning, and believe they are perfect and everything else is lesser. They dream, and sometimes pull things from their dreams into reality. That's how they reproduce, but unfortunately (fortunately for us) they tend to fight to the death when they meet. Very rarely, sometimes they see each other as \"me\" and form a hive mind.\n\nBilbo says there are at least *six* Xaryu. Basically they keep the halflings as livestock for the vampires to eat. That's why halflings get banished periodically. \"You don't stand a chance,\" he finishes sadly.\n\n\"We've heard that before!\" say Freki and Oz at the same time.\n\nBilbo is curious about the glacier. Who lives there? Cal says there weren't more halflings there. He lived with a race called the [giants](../creatures/giants). He was adopted. Or, y'know, traded. Acquired, even. To honor his father, he was given to [his new father](../dossiers/hyperion), and served (with) him until he joined the SPI. He spent a lot of time fighting off the undead.\n\n\"Vampires have to eat. It's in their nature,\" says Bilbo.\n\n\"They can eat my ass! We're ending this slave trade!\" says Oz.\n\n\"You were a sacrifice to the gods?\" Bec asks Cal.\n\n\"My father's not a god anymore,\" Cal says.\n\nTalking about studying the Arkenstone brings memories back to Vondal. He has some new ideas about how to enhance its resonance, so that it can reach its true structural potential. If he had access to the stone, maybe he could improve it!\n\nVondal drunkenly asks me: \"How did you get two of them? Because normally they fight.\"\n\nIt takes me a second, but I get he's talking about [my goddesses](../rules/dual-goddess). I say they have a special relationship. He's like, \"THEY'RE THE SAME!!!\"\n\nThere's a knock at the door, and a feminine voice says, \"It sounds like a party in here. Can I join?\"\n\nIt's [Avandra](../dossiers/avandra)! OMGOMGOMGOMG\n\nShe says quietly to me, \"I know you like [my sister](../dossiers/erathis) better than me. But it's OK, I don't mind.\"\n\nVondal says, \"So you belong to her, then?\"\n\nAvandra puts a hand on my shoulder and says, \"She's doing a great job.\" Cal senses shenanigans!\n\nVondal drunkenly complains that the gods should require their priests to be nicer to orphans. Avandra responds sadly that that isn't how it works. If you want the gods to change, you have to change the worshippers' hearts. She doesn't want to be what people expect. She wants to be herself! But that's because that's what her followers want her to want. She can never truly be free.\n\n\"To true freedom!\" she toasts.\n\n\"Anyway, I promise not to say anything about what I just figured out. I know that's why you're here,\" Vondal says sulkily.\n\n\"Everything is not about you,\" says Bec, who has been drinking tea the whole night.\n\nOz is really into rescuing the halfling village. Vondal and Bec corner him and ask what's weighing on his heart. Oz pretends to cry into his beer.\n\n\"What I'm trying to excommunicate&mdash;\" Vondal starts.\n\n\"Nope,\" says Bec.\n\n\"&mdash;explain, is that Cal is growing. He's opening up more.\"\n\nVondal wants to sleep off the ale, so he crashes in Bilbo's bed with Murky as a bat on his face.\n\nAvandra flips Oz a wooden coin with her symbol on both sides and tells him to bite it if he ever decides to forgo the direct approach in favor of a sneakier one. \"You'll know when it's time.\"\n", "id": "events/case-15e00"}, {"title": "[11e08] Epic Aboleth Battle", "description": "Aboleth battle", "datestamp": "50-05-21/08", "when": "AC50 Rixa 21", "session-number": 44, "session-date": "2020-01-25", "session-event": "https://www.facebook.com/events/2573562936206382/", "body": "1.

I remember her from [a case we were on](case-03). We went to arrest [Hollerd](../dossiers/hollerd-aldrimor), a [dwarf](../creatures/dwarves), on his ranch, for poisoning [his uncle](../dossiers/gurin-aldrimor). There was [a woman on the farm](../dossiers/tasper-ironroot) who tried to send us away, but we pushed past her and arrested him. Respa looks like that woman.\n\n[Freki](../dossiers/freki) asks if she has seen other people transform the way he does (into a [werewolf](../creatures/lycans)). She says she hasn't, and asks if many people outside the village can do it. He asks if any of them can, and she says no because none of them are tigers, wolves, rats, rhinoceroses, etc.\n\nShe says [Rotesabal](../dossiers/rotesabal) has a little friend, and [another person in the village](../dossiers/kiwooya) is a [bird](../creatures/aarakocra) (that would be the one who looks like a white bipedal bird).\n\n[Cal](../dossiers/cal) asks whether any of them are [undead](../creatures/undead). They are not!\n\n[Marigold](../dossiers/marigold-cogsworth) is the only [changeling](../creatures/changelings) present in the village right now. She keeps up the mind link so they can all communicate easily. Changelings that are outside aren't connected to the mind link. They need to be within 100 feet.\n\n[Eeoram](../dossiers/eeoram-sufur) is the alt-Mallory (i.e. the one we've all met). We haven't seen him in a long time!\n\nMarsh witch spends half her time in the forest and half in the marsh. Named [Grainne](../dossiers/grainne)/[Anorje](../dossiers/anorje-mistral).\n\nWe all have a drink at the pub before we go, and talk over what we've learned.\n\nWe need to rebuild the base and find the other SPI agents. Mallory has been burned by pure elemental fire and can only be healed with a focus of equal strength to the spell that burned him. Cal pipes up that now that he has his sword back, we could use that. Since it was the [Arkenstone](../relics/arkenstone) that burned him to begin with.\n\nWe convince Marigold to let us try to heal Mallory. [Bec](../dossiers/bec) makes a *tiny hut* around his bed, and [another magic user in the village](../dossiers/ayinalef) makes another barrier around the whole house. Bec, Cal, and [I](../dossiers/callie) try to do a healing ritual. Cal feels an intruder in his mind and tries to resist.\n\nCal places the Arkenstone on Mallory's forehead. I cast *bless* on us, then cast *cure wounds* at level 5. Bec supports with a 5th level spell. The stone explodes outward with healing light. Cal's job was to focus the effect, but Marigold's interference makes it too hard and he loses control of it.\n\nWave of sacred fire washes over. It is infused with healing energy but still painful. We take some damage, but Cal is able to redirect. I have to heal Marigold, but Mallory is saved!!!\n\nWe return to the pub so Mallory can catch up over a beer. He last talked to Eeoram about a month ago. He wants to know where [Vondal](../dossiers/vondal) is. We don't know any better than he does. He says Vondal has gotten worse if he keeps disappearing. He never did that before. We tell him that the HQ is more or less repaired and we've recruited some new people (Bec, [Oz](../dossiers/oz), Freki, the owlbear [Rain](../dossiers/rain) and [Squeaks McKraken](../dossiers/squeaks-mckraken)). Mallory sighs. \"[Wild magic](../locales/flux#wild-magic) sent 'em away, wild magic brings 'em back.\"\n\nMallory asks whether Vondal has screwed anything up lately, but we think he hasn't. He's relieved. He didn't want to fire Vondal. He says we need to get back into HQ and get things set up. We let him know that Cassandra is missing and we don't have any sending stones.\n\nWe decide to go to Vondal's house so we can meet up with Rain. Cassandra should be able to find us there, too. Rain says hello: \"Boss! And you guys!\"\n\nI send to Cassandra first. It feels like there's some kind of barrier, but I push through. \"Cassandra where are you? Are you in trouble? Can you get to Vondal's?\"\n\nThe monkey statue in Oz's bag turns into a real live winged monkey! Also all his shit falls all over the ground, LOL.\n\nThe monkey answers my question with monkey squeaking. The monkey...is Cassandra...?\n\nFreki can talk to animals, so he asks it some questions. The monkey recognizes Oz as its friend, but not Mallory. It rifles through Oz's bag and finds Vondal's cookies. It holds one up and then eats it, sharing with Oz.\n\nWe ask it what it is, but it just says \"I am me. I am two things.\"\n\nThe monkey points at Oz and the [Hornblade](../relics/cornucopia) and says they're both partners. Oz gives the monkey the sword. It holds up the sword, hops up and down, and then four wings pop out of its back. Two are the celestial wings it had before, two are shadow wings. The sword is the monkey's shadow, and the shadow has the shadow wings. Callie thinks there is some kind of deific power associated with the sword and the monkey is empowered by its mirror. [My](../dossiers/erathis) [goddesses](../dossiers/avandra) are twins, but they aren't opposites. The monkey and the sword are more like two sides of a coin. Cassandra is a divine spellcaster, and the monkey has done some divine magic. The sword is something different. \n\nWhile Bec and Callie discuss the feelings of the magic being wrong somehow, Freki smells something familiar. It makes his hackles rise. It was when [the orc lady](../dossiers/andalla) rubbed a statue and turned into a [demon](../creatures/demons). Freki smells...the statue/whatever magic that was.\n\nMallory tries to sum up: Cassandra is in the monkey? And the monkey is the sword? Where did the hornblade come from, anyway? Oz says that he took it from the fountain.\n\nWe take the monkey to the mirror. It looks transfixed for a moment, but then the mirror shatters. D'oh! Bec and Callie sweep it up so Callie can use *mending* on it. I notice that there's [a woman with dark hair](../dossiers/dallah-thaun) and arms crossed. When I look closer, [she's actually blonde](../dossiers/yondalla). When I look even closer...it's me. Weird!\n\nCallie does *augury* with tarot cards. Would it be a good idea to try *dispel magic* on the monkey? The final card is Strength. It's a good idea!\n\nBec and Callie cast *dispel magic* at 4th level together. It is kind of like pulling something out of the monkey. Bec and Callie can barely hang on. Cal's Arkenstone starts vibrating. The monkey is agitated. The celestial monkey and the monkey monkey are separated but stuck together by sticky strands. Cal slices through the strands and Cassandra appears and falls to the floor. The monkey turns back into a statue. The shadow goes back into the hornblade.\n\nOz grabs the statue and thinks \"be a monkey!\" It seems to want to, but it has a hard time. When it pops back into monkeyness, it seems very tired. The shadow stays in the sword and doesn't go back into the monkey. Freki gives the monkey some food and asks if it's OK. It's tired and misses the nice lady. The monkey eats the food and pets Cassandra's hair. It's unsure if Oz is still its friend, so Oz hugs it and allows it to go back to its pocket dimension to rest.\n\nCal says Cassandra wasn't the only thing in the monkey. Bec and Callie think the shadow wings might have been the other thing.\n\nMallory tries shaking Cassandra, but she doesn't wake up. He picks her up and puts her in Vondal's bed. He doesn't think she's going to wake up for a while.\n\nI have two *sendings* left. Who should we contact first? Mallory suggests that he can put out feelers to get [Sima](../dossiers/sima)'s body back from the [elves](../creatures/elves). Maybe Cassandra can rez her, if it's not her time to die. Mallory is excited to have another agent!\n\nWe decide Eeoram is the top priority. I try to cast *sending*, but I get a 404 :( His spirit is not on this plane. Although...where is it? Changelings can't be resurrected and we don't know how they reproduce.\n\nMallory says that when Vondal disappears, he's time traveling. I probably can't contact him.\n\nLet's try Squeaks. I do a *sending*: \"Mallory says to meet at [Triumph](../locales/triumph) recruitment circle, tomorrow 9 AM. Bring any other agents you can. Will brief everyone.\"\n\nSqueaks and the other two NPC agents (see [episode 2](../events/case-02)) have established field offices and each has been investigating some active cases.\n\n- Squeaks has been investigating in the city under the mountain, the dwarven lands. Our old friend [Sil](../dossiers/sil-aldrimor) is not in charge anymore. Someone else has called Squeaks to find out what happened in the goblin territory. They seem to have gotten encased in [karach](../relics/karach) or some kind of [crystalline flux](../locales/flux#crystalline-flux).\n\n- [Victor Rocksmith](../dossiers/victor-rocksmith), a hard-drinkin, hard-smokin sailor gnome, has been in the land of [Trell](../locales/trell). He says there's a political situation brewing. A hurricane has emerged from Trell and is heading towards the island-city of [Aether](../locales/aether) in [Skyrealm](../locales/skyrealm). The High Priest of [Pelor](../dossiers/pelor), [St. Benedor](../dossiers/benedor), has invoked the SPI to convince the [dragons](../creatures/dragons) not to dispel the hurricane. Pelor gave him a prophecy that the hurricane will cleanse [the desert lands](../locales/desert) and restore them. The desert has been overly dry since we took the cornucopia, oops.\n\n- [Lawrence Feathersworth](../dossiers/lawrence-feathersworth) was contacted by an agent of [the vampire](../dossiers/cronus). They are demanding the SPI's service. Agent went to [Arallu](../locales/arallu) and saw it briefly. They wanted him to enter [the manor](../locales/evershroud-manor) of [the archlich](../dossiers/timor-invictus), which has begun to exude some sort of power and no undead can enter it. Also, the archlich has not attended any meetings of the triumvirate. Where is he?\n\n### Open questions and next steps\n\n- Should we try to recover Sima's body and see if we can revive her? Or will one of us volunteer to be the anchor for Sima's double?\n- Vondal wants to find Mallory's doppelganger.\n- Vondal has a big lead on what happened to the SPI agents, and will want to follow up on it.\n- Freki wants to find out what happened to [Hugin](../dossiers/hugin) and [Munin](../dossiers/munin). They were somehow held at bay during the battle.\n- What was [Talos](../dossiers/talos) talking about?\n", "id": "events/case-14e00"}, {"title": "[05e01] The Temple of Symmetry", "description": "Agents defeat a dire threat at the Temple of Symmetry.", "datestamp": "50-03-19/01", "when": "AC50 Solis 19", "session-number": 11, "session-date": "2016-05-28", "session-event": "https://www.facebook.com/events/556824827819445/", "body": "* SPI agents travel to the temple of the [Progression of Symmetry](../orgs/progression-of-symmetry), a reclusive monastic order situated at the ultimate summit of the Cliffs of Transcendance.\n* Agents speak with [Ou-sh-](../dossiers/oush), the Grandmaster of Winds, one of four elemental masters of the monastic order. She is the one who called the SPI to investigate. They Progression is sworn not to get involved in corporeal affairs, instead pledging their lives to self-reflection and spiritual pursuit.\n* Ou-sh- tells the agents that people have been jumping from the Zenithal Summit platform and disappearing. When Mishaal, daughter of the Master of Fire [K\u00e1ra Halfdand\u00f3ttir](../dossiers/kara-halfdandottir), became one of the victims, her mother leaped after her and also disappeared, so Ou-sh- called for the SPI in response.\n* Agents speak with [Ceowyn Mandragoran](../dossiers/ceowyn-mandragoran), Master of Earth, who expresses his support for the Progression's policy of non-intervention.\n* Agents speak with [Sonan the Scholar](../dossiers/sonan-the-scholar), Master of Water, who has secretly kept a journal of all the victims' names&mdash;which include a young orphan&mdash;in violation of the order's edicts.\n* [Vondal](../dossiers/vondal)&mdash;who has a soft spot for orphans&mdash;is furious, runs outside, and blasts the platform (which the agents sense is radiating a strange power) with wild magic.

Inside, Vondal witnesses him use the lamp to transform into a white dragon. After a few moments, the dragon emerges from the rift and attacks the temple!\n* With help from the elemental masters, the agents defeat the dragon.\n* Meanwhile, Vondal navigates the [place he finds himself in](../locales/demonweb-pits), which seems to be some kind of flux-tainted demiplane filled with spiderwebs. He perceives a gargantuan spider just visible deep down below. He also discovers both Mishaal and K\u00e1ra bound in chaotic spiderwebs, with Mishaal's body partially corrupted by [Flux](../locales/flux).\n* Vondal manages to free them both from the webs, and carry them both (mentally) back through the rift. He is also able to extract the Flux within them by channeling it through himself, but at great cost: he falls unconscious, near death.\n* Sonan is able to heal Vondal using an unfamiliar technique. Vondal wakes up, and is totally fine.\n* Afterward the battle, the other agents investigate the acolyte's room, where they discover a journal with some details of his scheme, which involved sacrificing people as part of a secret cult.

It's where she's supposed to be. Okay, I get that.\n\nGoratrix says he's brought our winnings here. Meerlinda sets a bag down outside the door. What a mensch, this guy.\n\nBec asks why Goratrix has a beef with Lestache, but Gortrix says it's the other way around. Lestache is jealous because Goratrix built this city (not the ruins, the good part).\n\nFreki, with his low charisma, says Goratrix basically built like a block of a city, then. Oh dear, we should probably stop letting him talk.\n\nVondal asks what Goratrix wants. Goratrix says we should all ask ourselves that more often. He considers. It's power. Power is the thing he wants, and we are powerful. But so is he, so he holds our lives in his hands. \n\nWe try to suss out what the hell he wants. It seems he could, uh, take us now or wait until we're even more powerful. But that's risky, since we might get killed by someone else while he's waiting.\n\nGoratrix says if there's a Death Tyrant, then maybe the Zaryu tribe has a fallen member. So, is the SPI bound to stop it or what? Well...yes and no. Lacking our halfling murder squad, we'd probably just send this one up the flagpole and see if anyone salutes.\n\nSophie asks Goratrix why he even cares what we do. He says it's an event of interest, so he wants to know how we're going to proceed. He'd rather we not bring more SPI agents down here. Freki doesn't get why this is a problem. Goratrix explains that these things wash over the whole land and destroy everything, and he's really not down with that. Bec proposes that we join forces temporarily to take down the Death Tyrant.\n\nGoratrix says if it is around somewhere, he has an idea of where it might be, and it's a place vampires can't enter.  Vondal strikes a deal with him that if we go and investigate, he'll agree to not kill us and even discourage the other vampires from harming us. He's the best. The best we've got, anyway.\n\nHe swoops the bag into the shack telekinetically. Bec really wants to know how to do that rad magic, and he says he can teach her that and more if she joins her clan. Vondal determines that Goratrix doesn't particularly hate spiders, but he goes along with it because the other vamps do. Good to know (?).\n\nVondal suggests we take a rest. Since 3/4 of the current party is spellcasters, that sounds like a great plan to us. Goratrix teleports away. Sophie congratulates us on tricking him into giving up the location: the Soulbound Rest. She thinks I can cast a spell called \"Find the Path\" to get there, wherever it is. That's flattering, but I do not know that spell at all! Vondal has something similar, though he's reluctant to use his high-level spells to try and find this place.\n\nSophie thinks we need to go, but Vondal thinks we should stay put and rest. She is really keen to grab her cursed sword and go. That sword is like a bad boyfriend, she just will not accept the truth about it. \n\nI chat up Sophie about her service to Tiamat. She says most of her people follow Tiamat, who is the Best God. She didn't know Bilbo, though. I get the impression that she may have some other feelings about Tiamat, but she's not at liberty to say them out loud. She's used to being constantly watched by Zaryu and Tiamat, I guess.\n\nFreki really likes Sophie. She's his favorite halfling; she's only stabbed him once so far. Is this the only criterion, or...? Maybe it's just the most relevant one.\n\nWe divvy up the magic items during our rest. I swap out my Boots of Elvenkind with Boots of False Tracks. For the next few hours I am going to be a faun, haha.\n\nThen Goratrix shows up, pleased that we haven't run away. He flies off, and we take off after him on Bilbo's flying carpet. Eventually we get to a place with a rickety metal fence surrounding some kind of ruined estate. Goratrix says this is the realm of the spectral undead and therefore the vampires are not allowed to enter. Goratrix himself not only can't get in there, he doesn't even want to. That's strange for the guy who gets his kicks breaking and entering. \n\nThe negative energy here is off the charts. We all hate it. Sophie tells us that we'll be under Tiamat's protection. I mean, I'll take it. Sophie tells us that the Death Tyrant is a rebellious piece of Zaryu. That's why Zaryu wants it dead, because it wants all non-Zaryu things dead. Vondal senses a tremendously evil and powerful presence about half a mile away. Also the whole place is just blanketed with non-corporeal undead creatures.\n\nI cast Pass Without Trace to make Freki even more stealthy than he normally is, and make the rest of us somewhat less unstealthy. Sophie casts Bless on herself, Freki, and Vondal because he seems like he needs the most help. Still, just to minimize our risk, everybody except Freki gets in our portable hole and Freki slings it over his shoulder (I assume). As Freki is about to leave, Goratrix says \"Best of luck now.\" Meerlinda weaves an illusion of Freki's home for him, filling him with resolve and purpose. He does an awesome jump over the fence and feels confident.\n\nFreki's instincts are excellent right now, so Sophie follows his lead. He adjusts slightly to accommodate her while dodging the graves and whatnot that litter the ground. He also opens the hole periodically so we can breathe, for which I am very grateful. At one point along the way, Sophie steps on a branch and makes a sound. Freki hides, then looks around to see if anyone noticed and sees...GORATRIX! But, like, a ghosty version of him. It moans and floats over to a grave. It smells like sorrow and desperation, but not malicious or like a vampire anymore. \n\nAt another point, Sophie trips and three ghosts float over to investigate. She volunteers to get in the hole and hang out drinking sangria with the rest of us. (Just kidding obviously, we sure don't need any more hits to our dexterity.) Then Freki discovers a huge chapel. That's...probably the place.\n", "id": "events/case-15e05"}, {"title": "[06e02] Freki the Hunter, Freki the Witness", "description": "Slew demonic Manufeai reincarnations; met Freki.", "datestamp": "50-03-25/02", "when": "AC50 Solis 25", "session-number": 13, "session-date": "2016-10-29", "session-event": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1589437974695524/", "body": "1.

During that time, Leopold told them the story of Mungus and Gurin and the almost-kings: Mungus won the duel over Brie's heart, but was accused of cheating and was expelled from Clan Aldrimor.\n6. Mungus showed up and gave them the letter from Gurin begging Mungus to visit him. Mungus said that Gurin's family would be shamed\u2014and at least expelled from Aldrimor\u2014if the truth came out.\n7. Mungus uttered some words about how maybe the Clans would be dissolved some day. Mungus's daughter Larsa asked him to be quiet, but Vondal pressed for more details.

Was the Death Tyrant...feeding on it?\n>>>>>>> Stashed changes\n\nThe Brucolac bursts out of the sarcophagus. Its wings unfurl in the air. With a wave of its hand, it clothes and armors itself. We can't see the wings anymore, but it can still fly. It stares straight at Cal and something seems to pass between them. For the first time since I've ever known him, Cal doesn't want to kill undead? SNAP OUT OF IT, CAL!\n\nThe Brucolac looks at the Death Tyrant and orders it to leave. The Death Tyrant doesn't react in any way.\n\nI have a vision of an army of ghosts, swarming into the church, over us, and towards the Death Tyrant. I also hear the strumming of a harp, driving the ghosts towards the Death Tyrant. As more ghosts enter, the desecration gets worse. As the harp plays, everything ripples, shifts, and changes. It feels a bit like the Feywild. There's yet another will behind that, someone weaving reality. The feeling gets more intense until I snap out of it. I call out to my teammates, \"We have to get out of here or kill the Death Tyrant NOW!\"\n\nThe Death Tyrant sucks in the nearest ghosts. Its eye stalks look around and then it moves toward the Brucolac. It's like, \"I hunger\" and the Brucolac says \"I know.\" I'm tilting towards RUN at this point.\n\nOz does a flurry of attacks against the Death Tyrant and does some damage that can't be healed by, uh, ectophagy.\n\nBec, noticing that something is obviously wrong with Cal, tries to dispel whatever is affecting him. She successfully unravels the charm! Nice!\n\nThe Brucolac kind of offhandedly uses the power of this horrible place to do something horrible to us. We all lose some of our vitality!\n\n<<<<<<< Updated upstream\n> Michael: \"If we *all* fail, then it's not a very good teacher.\"\n=======\n===============================================================\nMichael: \"If we *all* fail, then it's not a very good teacher.\"\n===============================================================\n>>>>>>> Stashed changes\n\nFreki makes an arrow on the fly, prays to his bird friends, and swears an oath on his bow: \"A swift death to those who have wronged me. May my bow strike true, and may this be the end of you.\" The bow whispers something back in Elven. Vondal seems like he's weaving some kind of massive enchantment or something (six sorcery points!) to help Freki's aim, too. Even with all the help, the arrow flies straight and true, but not exactly at the right...spot.... Hugin and Munin appear to escort the arrow!!! The Death Tyrant looks grievously wounded! Then it turns an eye stalk on Freki and shoots a ray at him.\n\nThe air starts to ripple OH NO IT'S JUST LIKE MY VISIONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN\n\nVondal starts firing magic beams. With each one, more green fur sprouts out of him until he's covered with it. And the Death Tyrant has been incinerated by Oscar the Grouch! What kind of armor class does a trashcan have?\n\n<<<<<<< Updated upstream\nThe shimmering in the air stops. That's a relief! Now we can be killed by the Brucolac instead. \n=======\nThe shimmering in the air stops. That's a relief! Now we can be killed by the Brucolac instead.\n>>>>>>> Stashed changes\n\nThe Brucolac thanks us for purging his sanctum. We all look over at Cal, except Freki, who says, \"Well met.\" Ironically, that's probably the most diplomatic response any of us could muster.\n\nThe Brucolac says his house seems to be in some disorder. While he is deeply malevolent, he's not actively trying to kill us, so that's nice. I feel that he is shaken by this experience, which should not have been able to happen. He's also furious, unsurprisingly. Should I point his ire in some direction that isn't us? Probably should, right? Yeah, probably should.\n\nVondal notices that even though the Death Tyrant was slain, the power of the Flux here is still super strong and the stained glass windows are still messed up. Whatever's wrong seems to be ingrained in this place.\n\n<<<<<<< Updated upstream\nFreki smells something like Oz (or his sword) from the shadow woman. The other woman smells like Cal, or his sword.

She lacks subtlety, but knowing his motivation is just paralyzing me with fear, to be quite honest, so maybe it's best not to be burdened with knowledge sometimes.\n\nThe Brucolac acknowledges that consuming us would give him more power, sure, but he thinks we have a part to play besides being eaten by him. Which is more than we could have expected from him, really.\n\nVondal, meanwhile, puts his hand on one of the windows and gets sucked in. I mean, I wish I could say I'm surprised? He finds himself on a hill with three elves and a ring. He feels himself being torn. His two halves are separating. Eventually the ring's power will wash over the world and heal everything, but when it reaches the apex of its power, the ring cracks! With a feeling of deep betrayal, Vondal gets thrown out the window. He has just witnessed the birth of the Flux. One of them ruined the ritual and created the Fluxx. This is all because of some asshole elf! Let's find them and kill them! He recognized two of the elves: Janus Ilaris (now the Ghost here in zombieland), one was Priscilla Stormcloud, and the other one was someone Vondal knows but couldn't see.\n\n<<<<<<< Updated upstream\nThe Brucolac tells Vondal that he's playing with fire and it's only a matter of time before it destroys his mind. \n=======\nThe Brucolac tells Vondal that he's playing with fire and it's only a matter of time before it destroys his mind.\n>>>>>>> Stashed changes\n\nOz taps at one of the windows, feels his head exploding, and knows that the woman in the window is the woman from his sword. She reaches out to touch his head and impart the depths of her pain. Her name is Dallah Thaun. She was betrayed by someone, and it's Oz's job to find out who and wreak her terrible vengeance.\n\nCal goes and stands near the other window. He feels deep sadness and knows she is dead. The Flux has started to erase her. That's why her face is obscured.\n\nBec is trying to figure out what it all means, but she realizes that she can't get it right now.\n\n<<<<<<< Updated upstream\nCal touches the middle window.\n\n> GM's note: Cal has a vision of [Moradin](../dossiers/moradin) in full steampunk armor the Arkenstone into a sword:\n>\n> ![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6a/f6/86/6af686a23088c1821a40ce87a8238e26.jpg)\n>\n> \"Mother... we will make them remember...\"\n\nThe Brucolac says, \"Perhaps I spoke too soon.

The Brucolac says, \"Perhaps I spoke too soon. More and more you grow.\" Cal asks if he knows the people in the windows, but the Brucolac says he can't remember.\n>>>>>>> Stashed changes\n\nOz tries to pick the Brucolac's pocket. He feels something he really didn't want to feel, but at least he didn't get noticed and turned into some kind of flesh milkshake.\n\nThe Brucolac (who used to be known as Cronus) says he remembers \"devouring them all, including her. But I do not remember who she is.\" Cal thinks Morrigan (?), who wants revenge, may have been devoured by this guy. But Vondal said the Flux was caused by elves, and what Cronus is talking about happened a long time ago, much longer than the Flux.\n\nOz wants to liberate the halfling ranch. The Brucolac asks what our companion would say about that. Sophie says the Death Tyrant is dead, so everything is fine now. Also she doesn't believe the Brucolac isn't in league with Xaryu, though he says he isn't.\n\nSophie says if he's really thankful to us, he can help us destroy Xaryu. And don't eat us while he's doing it, please and thank you!\n\nThe Brucolac says he wants our information if we expect to get anything from him. Cal says that he thinks the Ghost sicced the Death Tyrant on him, but the Brucolac thinks he and the Ghost are allies and this is unlikely. So I tell him what I saw in my visions. He says that information is valuable enough to merit him sending \"an agent\" with us, if that's what we want. Someone who fills a need in our party, someone patient and smart. Hey now, I do not say out loud.\n\nWe can choose one of these three: Calderon the Cold, who knows all about spiders and tunnels. Orlok, who can find anything and go anywhere. Or Elloia Canarl, a consummate hunter (though she might start by hunting Oz, and who could blame her?).\n\n<<<<<<< Updated upstream\n> Nate: \"Let's take the they/them and stir up some may-hem!\"  \n> Curtis: \"Orlok goes by *it*.\"  \n> Michael: \"Let's take the it and stir up some shit!\"\n=======\n==========================================================\nNate: \"Let's take the 'they/them' and stir up some may-hem!\"\nCurtis: \"Orlok goes by 'it'.\"\nMichael: \"Let's take the 'it' and stir up some shit!\"\n==========================================================\n>>>>>>> Stashed changes\n\nSophie says before we teleport out, this is the last time we should speak freely because Xaryu is always watching. ALWAYS WATCHING. Even sign language is out!\n\nWe all go through the portal. Oz yells \"Your wings look like shit!\" as he's about to step through the portal. The Brucolac reaches out to close the portal, so Oz, reading the action, backflips through it before it can close.\n\nLeft alone with the Brucolac, Cal says, \"What now, uncle?\"\n\nThe Brucolac tells him that Xaryu is what prevents the vampires from wiping out the halflings entirely, so is the situation really so simple? Cal responds that nothing is ever simple. \"Truer words were never spoken,\" says the Brucolac, and lets Cal go.\n\nLingering questions:\n - Two vampires connected to Goratrix seem to be involved in this...assassination attempt...so why did Goratrix lead us right here?\n - If vampires aren't allowed to set foot here, as Goratrix said, then what was the Brucolac doing here?\n - Was Meerlinda's dream power involved in creating the Death Tyrant in the first place? Seems like her wheelhouse.\n - But in my vision, someone was directing the ghosts to feed the Death Tyrant, so maybe Janus Ilaris?

Now it is a sore point for the dwarves\u2014so as a compromise, most simply call it \"the Mountain\" to avoid incurring the ire of their fellows. Plus, foreigners always mangle dwarven pronunciation anyway.\n\n* **Population:** The dwarves are hardy, practical, and many in number. Non-dwarves sometimes join dwarven farming communities, but very rarely make their home in the tunnels of the Mountain itself.\n* **Government:** [Patriarchal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy) [monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy). The King of the Dwarves rules justly, with seven High Clans serving as his advisers and implementers of dwarven law.

The forest's crowning feature is the Yggdrasil, the World Tree, said to have been planted at the dawn of time by the gods themselves.\n\n* **Population:** The elves are skilled, wise, and few in number. But the great forest of Elyria is home to more than just elves: it is the realm of the [fey](https://dungeonsdragons.fandom.com/wiki/Fey). And the deeper into the woods one travels, the more strange and powerful the fey residents become.\n* **Government:** [Matriarchal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matriarchy) [monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy). The elven queen rules\u2014and is bonded to\u2014the Faerie Court, consisting of representatives from many sylvan races. Two factions exist within the Court, Seelie and Unseelie, and the Court's makeup sways the queen's disposition accordingly. In this way, she is a direct manifestation of the Court's will.\n* **Cities and culture:** Elves are very philosophical, and believe in a balance of all things. They strive to live in harmony with their environment and each other. Their Seelie aspect seeks to promote peace and tranquility, while their Unseelie aspect seeks to stamp out threats and disruptions to the balance of existence. As such, they hold a particular hatred for their neighbors on both sides: the undead to the west, and the orcs to the east.\n  * Estanesse is said to be the first and most grand elven city, nestled near the Yggdrasil at the border of the Deepwood.\n\nThe elves were slow to enter the War of Countless Deaths. Historically, Elyria had been highly homogeneous, their isolationist politics a reflection of their long lives in the shadow of the ancient, unknown powers of the Deepwood. With little concern for short-term goals, conflict between the lesser races in the north simply wasn't a priority. After all, the Elves had a higher calling: protecting the Yggdrasil from disease and incursion, for should it die, the world would surely die with it.\n\nChange came with the humans: a tide of civilian refugees and military deserters poured over the Elyrian borders. They came seeking respite from the war and harsh lives on the scorching plains. A lack of immediate response from the Queen allowed for unregulated mixing of the cultures. In some cases, local communities welcomed the addition of curious outsiders. But for most of northern Elyria, this became a time of conflict\u2014driven by greed, jealousy, and resentment.\n\nEventually, a massive Elven army was mobilized. The human incursion was halted\u2014their straggling militias purged, and settlers evicted. While this certainly accelerated Elvish involvement in the War, it also changed the composition and outlook of Elyria itself. Pockets of human settlers and human-elf communities have inevitably remained, with a relative explosion of mixed race births.\n\nToday, Elyria stands polarized. To the south, the forests remain timeless. As one travels north, the influence of humanity\u2014both physical and psychological\u2014becomes increasingly apparent. Border elves, and half-elves, have experienced loss in a way their pure brethren to the south have not. For these individuals, living in the shadow of the Flux, the general sentiment is that caution and deliberation have either failed them, or prepared them for the challenges of the times.

Once on the west coast of Aecus, the story goes that it was reclaimed by the sea: the coastline collapsed, and the city sank. Some believe the event was an act of war, others a punishment by the gods. But no one living then has clear memories of exactly what happened. Since then, gnomes have been few and far between.\n\n* **Population:** Before its disappearance, Cognitutus was inhabited almost exclusively by gnomes, though the occasional off-race tinkerer would settle down there, starry eyed, hoping to absorb a fraction of the gnomish fevered insight into technology.\n* **Government:** [Meritocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy). The city was governed by an elected Board of [Regents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regent#Other_uses) who each served for one year, and were not eligible for subsequent reelection.\n* **Cities and culture:** Cognitutus was famed for being a wondrous hub of innovation and invention. New creations are a badge of pride for every gnome\u2014whereas repeating the same endeavor, no matter how successful or useful it was before, is generally considered a waste of time. Gnomes invent unique and incredible machines, mechanisms and magic, but almost never mass produce their creations. Many times, they couldn't even if they wanted to, their work having been produced in a flash of inspiration or rare lucky break.\n* **Deities worshipped:** The twin goddesses [Erathis](../dossiers/erathis) and [Avandra](../dossiers/avandra) are often regarded by gnomes as two forces in balance, each stronger because of the other's influence. Some gnomes even believe they are two faces of the same goddess who they call [Ioun](../dossiers/ioun), goddess of knowledge, prophecy and skill.\n\n## The true fate of the city\n\nThe city sinking into the sea was planned by the gnomes, to escape the escalating conflict of the war. Many of the city's most talented inventors worked for years to design underwater containment and propulsion systems, so that the city could become a self-sustaining mobile undersea bubble.\n\nThe bubble is cloaked from the outside with an invisibility spell; it is mobile via four gigantic rotating turrets; and roving a few miles away from the bubble is the WOW, a jumbo sized [will-o'-wisp](https://dungeonsdragons.fandom.com/wiki/Will-o'-Wisp) whose job it is to draw undersea travelers away from the city toward shinier waters.\n\nResidents of the city subsist largely on undersea flora and fauna. There are many gnomish gatherers dedicated to harvesting the sea life as the city moves around, using unique underwater crafts of their own design. These \"farmers\" do need defensive capabilities, to avoid the myriad dangers of undersea life outside the city walls. The city's propulsion is fueled by undersea minerals, which the farmers also harvest. To renew the air supply, the city must come to the surface once every few years.\n\nThe city requires substantial resources to keep working, so it rarely doubles back to already harvested areas. Thus, as the years go by, the gnomes find themselves further and further west, deeper and deeper into the vastness of the Infinite Ocean...\n", "id": "locales/cognitutus"}, {"title": "The Scorching Plains", "image": "https://i.pinimg.com/236x/f9/a2/38/f9a238f92b8be0249504c09987c00bf8.jpg", "image-source": "https://www.pinterest.com/pin/123708321008020558/", "body": "Northeast of the [Flux](flux) lies a plain adjacent to the [Ventosa Flatland](ventosa), but hotter, with winds that can burn skin.

As an action, choose one undead creature you can see within 60ft of you. You immediately learn whether the creature has any damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities and what they are. If the creature is hidden from divination magic, you sense none.**Exterminator's Prey:** You can focus your ire on one foe, increasing the harm you inflict on it. As a bonus action, you designate one undead creature you can see within 60ft. The first time each turn that you hit this target with a weapon, it takes an additional 1d10 damage from the weapon. This benefit lasts until you finish a rest. It ends early if you designate a different undead creature. |\n|     9 | **Supernatural Defense:** You gain resilience against your prey's assaults on your mind and body. Whenever the target of your Exterminator's Prey forces you to make a saving throw and whenever you make an ability check to escape that target's grapple, add 1d10 to your roll.\n|    13 | **Ambush Master.** You excel at leading ambushes and acting first in a fight. You have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, the first undead creature you hit during the round of combat becomes easier for you and others to strike; attack rolls against that target have advantage rolls until the start of your next turn. |\n|    17 | **Sudden Strike.** You gain the ability to counterattack when your prey tries to sabotage you. If the target of your Exterminator's Prey forces you to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against the quarry. You make this attack immediately before making the saving throw. If your attack with advantage hits, your save automatically succeeds, in addition to the attack's normal effects. |\n", "id": "rules/undead-exterminator"}, {"title": "Cleric of the Dual Goddess", "image": "https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/154487/assets/682434/Avandra_-_Picture_01.jpg", "image-source": "https://changingofthegods.obsidianportal.com/wikis/avandra", "body": "The [gnomes](../creatures/gnomes) of [Cognitutus](../locales/cognitutus) revere two goddesses: [Erathis](../dossiers/erathis), goddess of civilization and invention, and [Avandra](../dossiers/avandra), goddess of change, luck, trade, and travel. Gnomes often debate which goddess is the \"true face\" of divinity, with many believing that gnomish fortunes are best when the two are in balance. Some gnomes even believe them to be two faces of the same greater deity, whom they call [Ioun](../dossiers/ioun), goddess of knowledge, prophecy, and skill.\n\n\n\nClerics who worship these two goddesses while following this philosophy are known as clerics of the dual goddess.\n\n## Spells known\n\nAs a cleric of the dual goddess, has two lists of spells known: one for Knowledge and one for Trickery.\n\nYou know a number of Knowledge spells equal to your cleric level + Intelligence modifier. These spells do not all need to be directly Knowledge related, but they should be spells that make sense for Erathis to be willing and able to grant you.\n\nYou know a number of Trickery spells equal to your cleric level + Charisma modifier.

At a given time, your holy symbol is either Knowledge-forward or Trickery-forward. This choice determines the spells known to which you have access in the moment. You can flip your holy symbol to the other goddess as a bonus action.\n\nWhen casting a spell from your Knowledge list, you may choose to use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Wisdom modifier.

It was adapted from the [werewolf rules](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17057-werewolf) and [The Complete Guide to Lycanthropy in D&D 5e](https://halflinghobbies.com/the-complete-guide-to-lycanthropy-in-dd-5e/).*\n\nYou have an animal within, which manifests under certain conditions such as during a full moon, in times of high emotional stress, physical trauma, or other triggers.\n\n**Keen Hearing and Smell.** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely primarily on hearing or smell.\n\n**Shapeshift.** You can use your action to transform into a beast, a [bipedal](../glossary#bipedal) beast hybrid, or back into your natural form. Your statistics, other than its AC, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed.\n\nIn these alternate forms, your statistics are adjusted as follows:\n  * Beast: +4 Str, +2 Dex, +4 Con, -4 Int, -4 Wis, +20 speed.\n  * Hybrid: +2 Str, +2 Con, -2 Int, -2 Wis, +10 speed.\n\nIn beast form, your limbs become too unwieldy to manipulate weapons and other tools, whereas in hybrid form, you can continue to use such items normally.\n\nIn difficult or extraordinary circumstances, the GM may call for a Wisdom saving throw to resist transforming, or to succeed in reverting to natural form.\n\nWhile in these alternate forms, you gain the following natural weapon attack options:\n\n* **Claw.** 2d4 + Str slashing damage.\n\n* **Bite.** 1d8 + Str piercing damage.\n  * If you successfully hit a target one size larger than you or smaller, you can use a bonus action to attempt to grapple. Make an opposed Strength (athletics) check. If successful, the creature is [grappled](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#grappled_phb) by you.\n  * If the target is a [bipedal](../glossary#bipedal) creature, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + proficiency bonus + Con modifier) or be cursed with lycanthropy.\n\n* **Multiattack.** When you take the Attack action you can attack multiple times: once with a claw, and once with a bite.\n\n### Extra Attack\n\nBeginning at 5th level, you can make an additional attack whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. In beast or hybrid form, this attack takes the form of a second claw attack, whereas in natural form this attack is typically a second weapon attack.\n\n### Improved Beast Form\n\nAt 6th level, your beast form grows in power. Choose one of the following abilities:\n\n* **Damage Resistances.** You are resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't silvered.\n\n* **Primal Strike.** Natural weapon attacks in beast or hybrid form count as magical +1.\n\n* **Savage Critical.** Your natural weapon attacks score a critical hit on 19 or 20.\n\n* **Scent of Blood.** After damaging an enemy in beast form, you become attuned to the smell their blood. Your attacks versus that target do an additional +2d6 damage, and you always know their exact location&mdash;meaning they don't benefit from concealment&mdash;as long as they are within your reach. Your actions not focused on this specific enemy are at disadvantage as long as you continue to smell its blood.\n\n* **Thrash.** In lieu of a natural weapon attack, you can smash a grappled creature into the creatures around it. Make a melee weapon attack against each creature adjacent to the grappled creature, treating the grappled creature as an improvised weapon that deals 1d6 + Str bludgeoning damage.\n\nThese abilities also become available as [feats](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/customization-options#Feats).\n\n### Greater Beast Form\n\nAt 14th level, your beast form reaches its pinnacle. Choose one of the following abilities:\n\n* **At One with the Beast.** You have honed your mental control over your inner beast. You no longer suffer the ability score penalties to Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma while in beast form, nor do you need to make a saving throw to control your transformations while in extraordinary circumstances.\n\n* **Primordial Strike.** Natural weapon attacks in beast or hybrid form count as magical +2.\n\n* **Extra Natural Attack.** While in beast or hybrid form, you can make an additional natural weapon attack as part of your Multiattack action, either a claw or a bite.\n\nAlternately, you may choose two additional abilities from the 6th level [Improved Beast Form](#improved-beast-form) list. These greater abilities also become available as [feats](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/customization-options#Feats).\n\n## Special Arrows\n\n*Together with Innate Natural Abilities, this ability replaces the [standard ranger's Spellcasting](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/ranger#Spellcasting-297).*\n\n* At 2nd level, you learn to create unique types of arrows, made from natural flora and fauna of the jungle or other region(s). You know how to craft a number of arrow types as follows: L2:2, L3-4:3, L5-6:4, L7-8:5, etc.\n  * Work with the GM to create each arrow type. As a rule of thumb, choose either: A) a ranger spell that makes sense as an arrow, of a level a standard ranger could normally cast; or B) an arrow type listed in the [arcane archer arcane shot options](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter:arcane-archer).\n* There is no limit to the number of arrows you may prepare or use, but crafting the arrows takes time and resources. You may spend a day harvesting materials and crafting arrows. You make a Survival roll:\n  * DC 15 to harvest materials for one arrow of a random type\n  * DC 20 to focus on harvesting materials for a specific type of arrow\n  * For every 5 exceeding the DC, you harvest materials for another arrow.\n* The arrows last awhile, but not forever: eventually the plant matter decays. Arrows more than ~1 month old have a chance of diminished effect. The GM rolls this chance secretly when the arrow is used.\n\n### Example Special Arrow Types\n\n| Min. level | Arrow Type |\n|:----------:|:-----------|\n|      2     | [Ensnaring Strike](https://5e.tools/spells.html#ensnaring%20strike_phb) |\n|      2     | [Hail of Thorns](https://5e.tools/spells.html#hail%20of%20thorns_phb) |\n|      3     | [Acid Arrow](https://5e.tools/spells.html#melf%27s%20acid%20arrow_phb) |\n|      3     | [Spike Growth](https://5e.tools/spells.html#spike%20growth_phb) |\n|      5     | [Lightning Arrow](https://5e.tools/spells.html#lightning%20arrow_phb) |\n|      9     | [Arrow of Slaying](https://5e.tools/items.html#arrow%20of%20slaying%20%28*%29_dmg) |\n\n## Innate Natural Abilities\n\n*Together with Special Arrows, this ability replaces the [standard ranger's Spellcasting](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/ranger#Spellcasting-297).*\n\n* The ranger has a number of abilities equal to the number of ranger \"spells known\"\n* The player should work with the GM to create abilities. Each ability needs some animalistic tie or justification to fit the theme. As a rule of thumb, choose a ranger spell that makes sense as an innate ability, whose level is less than or equal to what a standard ranger of that level could cast. The ability may need adjustment to fit as an innate ability rather than a spell.\n\n### Example Innate Natural Abilities\n\n| Min. level | Ability | Description/Notes |\n|:----------:|:--------|:------------------|\n|      2     | [Hunter's mark](https://5e.tools/spells.html#hunter%27s%20mark_phb) | Once per short rest \u2013 but the ability is regained immediately if current target dies. |\n|      2     | [Animal friendship](https://5e.tools/spells.html#animal%20friendship_phb) | Cast as a ritual &ndash; takes 5 minutes to bond with an animal. Animal must be neutral or friendly to initiate. |\n|      2     | [Speak with animals](https://5e.tools/spells.html#speak%20with%20animals_phb) | Requires concentration &ndash; uses an action each round of use. |\n|      3     | Swift shot | As a bonus action, draw and fire an arrow at -4 penalty. |\n|      3     | Beast sense | You use your action to transfer your consciousness to your beast companion. You see through its eyes, and hear what it hears for up to 1 hour, while becoming oblivious to your own usual sight and hearing. Another action returns you to your own body. |\n|      5     | Focused shot | You can focus your concentration when attacking at range. As an action while no enemy threatens you in melee, you make one ranged attack with advantage, and add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll. |\n|      5     | [Water breathing](https://5e.tools/spells.html#water%20breathing_phb) | You have gills or some other means to breathe underwater. |\n|      5     | [Speak with plants](https://5e.tools/spells.html#speak%20with%20plants_phb) | Requires concentration \u2013 uses an action each round of use. |\n|     13     | [Regeneration](https://5e.tools/spells.html#regenerate_phb) | You regain 1 hit point at the start of each of your turns (10 hit points each minute). Severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the limb knits to the stump instantaneously. |\n\n## Beast Companion\n\n*This ability replaces the [standard ranger's 3rd level archetype](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/ranger#RangerArchetypes) ability. See also the [Ranger's Companion](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/ranger:beast-master#toc0) and [Primal Companion](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/ranger:beast-master#toc1) options of the Beast Master ranger archetype.*\n\nAt 3rd level, you become bonded to mystic spirit animals of unknown origin. They are loyal, but not beholden, to you.\n\n## Primeval Awareness\n\n*This ability replaces the [standard ranger's Primeval Awareness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/ranger#PrimevalAwareness-299).*\n\nBeginning at 3rd level, you can use your action to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestiais, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. You sense the creatures' approximate direction (but not exact location or number), as well as approximate strength of presence, which is affected by the creatures' quantity, force of will and distance. Use of this ability is regained with a long rest.\n\n## Preternatural Reflexes\n\n*This ability replaces the [standard ranger's 7th level archetype](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/ranger#RangerArchetypes) ability.*\n\nWhile in your favored terrain, you have advantage on initiative checks.\n\n## Multiattack\n\n*This ability functions as the [standard ranger's 11th level archetype](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/ranger#RangerArchetypes) ability. It is copied verbatim from the [Hunter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/ranger#Hunter) archetype.*\n\nAt 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.\n\n* **Volley.** You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon\u2019s range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target.\n\n* **Whirlwind Attack.** You can use your action to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.\n\n## Superior Hunter\u2019s Defense\n\n*This ability functions as the [standard ranger's 15th level archetype](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/ranger#RangerArchetypes) ability. It is copied verbatim from the [Hunter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/ranger#Hunter) archetype.*\n\nAt 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.\n\n* **Evasion.** When you are subjected to an effect, such as a red dragon\u2019s fiery breath or a lightning bolt spell, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.\n\n* **Stand Against the Tide.** When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.\n\n* **Uncanny Dodge.** When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack\u2019s damage against you.\n\n## Legendary Hunter\n\n*This ability replaces the [standard ranger's Foe Slayer](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/ranger#FoeSlayer-306).*\n\nAt 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.\n", "id": "rules/lycan-ranger"}, {"title": "Spells", "image": "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0f/ec/ce/0feccede3b7b4b18868110d1621bcd88.jpg", "image-source": "https://www.pinterest.com/pin/696721004834766761/", "body": "## Analyze Portal (Age of Freedom)\n\n*3rd level divination*\n\n**Casting Time:** 1 minute  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a crystal lens and a small mirror)  \n**Range:** 60 ft  \n**Area:** Cone-shaped emanation from you to the extreme of the range  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 round per level  \n**Saving Throw:** See text  \n**Spell Resistance:** No\n\n*Seeing with a magic eye, you sense the portal. Studying it, knowledge about the portal comes into your mind as though it was a memory you could not recall until now.*\n\nYou can tell whether an area contains a magical portal or the effect of a gate spell. If you study an area for 1 round, you know the sizes and locations of any such portals in the area. Once you find a portal, you can study it. (If you find more than one portal, you can study only one at a time.)\n\nEach round you study a portal, you can discover one property of the portal, in this order.\n\n* Any key or command word needed to activate the portal.\n* Any special circumstances governing the portal's use (such as specific times when it can be activated).\n* Whether the portal is one-way or two-way.\n* A glimpse of the area where the portal leads.

For example, you cannot also use **detect magic** or **detect evil** to study the area where the portal leads while viewing the area with **analyze portal**.\n\nFor each property, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 17. If fail, you can try again in the next round.\n\n*Analyze portal* has only a limited ability to reveal unusual properties, as follows.\n\n* Random Portals: The spell reveals only that the portal is random and whether it can be activated now. It does not reveal when the portal starts or stops functioning.\n* Variable Portals: The spell reveals only that the portal is variable. If you study the portal's destination, the spell reveals only the destination to which the portal is currently set.\n* Creature-Only Portals: The spell reveals this property. If you study the portal's destination, the spell reveals where the portal sends creatures. If it is the kind of portal that sends creatures to one place and their equipment to another place, the spell does not reveal where the equipment goes.\n* Malfunctioning Portals: The spell reveals only that the portal is malfunctioning, not what sort of malfunction the portal produces.\n\n*Source: Spell Compendium p. 10*\n\n## Copy (Age of Zas)\n\n*1st level evocation*\n\n**Casting Time:** 1 minute  \n**Range:** Special  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of blank parchment, or a book with blank pages, and a drop of black ink)  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\nCopy enables you to make a perfect copy of a map, letter, or any other written or drawn document. You must have a blank parchment or a book with blank pages of sufficient size to hold the copy. You hold the blank object over the object to be copied, then cast the spell; the copy immediately appears on the formerly blank object. The copy is permanent and is a perfect duplicate of the original.\n\nCopy can also be used to copy a 1st level spell from a new spell book into the your spell book, assuming your spell book is of sufficient size to contain the new spells, and you possess the necessary magical inks of sufficient value (typically 50 gp per spell level; see [Copying a Spell into the Book](https://www.5esrd.com/database/class/wizard/#TOC-Your-Spellbook)). The copied spell is instantly transcribed into your spell book using the magical inks, adapted to your personal spellcasting notation.\n\n**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can copy a spell whose level is the same level as the spell slot used.For example, casting at 4th level allows you to copy a 4th level spell into your spellbook.\n\n*Source: AD&D 2nd Edition, The Complete Wizard's Handbook, Chapter 8*  \nhttps://adnd2e.fandom.com/wiki/Copy\n\n## Deeppockets (Age of Zas)\n\n*2nd level enchantment/transmutation*\n\n**Casting Time:** 10 minutes  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Target:** 1 garment  \n**Components:** V, S, M (tiny golden needle and a strip of fine cloth)  \n**Duration:** 12 hrs. + 1 hr. per level\n\nThis spell enables you to specially prepare a garment so as to hold far more than it normally could. A finely sewn gown or robe of high quality material (at least 50 gp value) is fashioned so as to contain numerous hand-sized pockets. One dozen is the minimum number.\n\nThe deeppockets spell then enables these pockets to hold a total of 100 pounds (five cubic feet in volume) as if it were only 10 pounds of weight. Furthermore, there are no discernible bulges where the special pockets are. At the time of casting, you can instead chose to have 10 pockets each holding 10 pounds (1/2 cubic foot volume each).\n\nIf the robe or like garment is sewn with 100 or more pockets (200 gp minimum cost), 100 pockets can be created to contain one pound of weight and 1/6 cubic foot volume each. Each special pocket is actually an extradimensional holding space.\n\nIf the spell duration expires while there is material within the enchanted pockets, or if a successful *dispel magic* is cast upon the enchanted garment, all the material suddenly appears around the wearer and immediately falls to the ground. You can also cause all the pockets to empty with a single command. \n\n*Source: AD&D 2nd Edition Player's Handbook p. 182*  \nhttps://adnd2e.fandom.com/wiki/Deeppockets\n\n## Distract Assailant (Age of Freedom)\n\n*1st level enchantment*\n\n**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  \n**Components:** V, S, M (the dried wing of a fly)  \n**Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  \n**Target:** One creature  \n**Duration:** 1 round  \n**Saving Throw:** Wisdom negates  \n**Spell Resistance:** Yes\n\n*Buzzing under your breath like a fly, you swat at the sky and toss the fly's wing in your hand into the air. The target of your spell becomes distracted, starting at shadows and looking about for unseen assailants.*\n\nA creature affected by this spell can't take reactions and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws until the beginning of its next turn.\n\n*Source: Spell Compendium p. 69*\n\n## Glass Strike (Age of Freedom)\n\n*7th level transmutation*\n\n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Components:** V, S, F (a piece of glass from a mirror)  \n**Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 levels)  \n**Target:** One creature or 4 cubic ft. of material  \n**Duration:** 1 hour per level  \n**Saving Throw:** Constitution negates  \n**Spell Resistance:** Yes\n\n*The spell erupts from the surface of the mirror you hold, striking your foe square in the chest and transforming it to glass.*\n\nYou transform the target into glass. You can cast either of these two versions:\n\n* Glass Creature: As [flesh to stone](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/3e_SRD:Flesh_to_Stone), but the subject becomes glass.\n\n* Glass Object: An object of up to 4 cubic feet in volume is affected. Part of a larger object (such as a floor or wall) can be transformed by this spell. Glass has hardness 1, and 1 hit point per inch of thickness.\n\nNeither version of the spell affects magic items (magic items carried by a transformed creature remain intact). When the duration ends, the subject returns to its original materials.

Opponents under the influence of this spell make all saving throws at a penalty of -2.\n\nAlternatively, you may select any one school of magic and cause your enemies to make all saving throws against magic from that school at -3.\n\n*Source: AD&D 2nd Edition Tome of Magic p. 29*  \nhttps://adnd2e.fandom.com/wiki/Greater_Malison\n\n## Haste (Age of Freedom)\n\n*6th level transmutation*\n\n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Components:** V, S, M  \n**Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 levels)  \n**Target:** One creature  \n**Duration:** 1 round per level  \n**Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates (harmless)  \n**Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)\n\nThe transmuted creature moves and acts more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several effects.\n\n* On its turn, the subject may do one of the following things as a bonus action:\n  * Move up to their movement speed.\n  * Make a single attack (melee, ranged, or unarmed).\n  * Cast a spell with a normal casting time of 1 action.\n  * Activate a magic item that normally requires an action to activate.\n  * Use a special ability that normally requires an action to use.\n* The subject gains a +4 haste bonus to AC. The subject loses this bonus whenever it would lose a dodge bonus.\n* The subject can jump one and a half times as far as normal. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus.\n\n*Haste* dispels and counters *slow*.\n\n*Source: D&D 3rd Edition Player's Handbook*  \nhttps://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/3e_SRD:Haste\n\n## Monk's Fighting Grace (Age of Freedom)\n\n*2nd level transmutation*\n\n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Personal  \n**Target:** You  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** 1 minute per level\n\nYou become a skilled unarmed fighter, gaining the ability to fight as a monk. You gain a mystic insight into the training necessary to fight with your fists and feet, allowing you to make phenomenal attacks that overwhelm your enemies.\n\nYou gain the Improved Unarmed Strike feat and a +2 competence bonus to hit with your unarmed attacks. These attacks deal 1d6 points of normal damage. You gain an insight bonus to your AC equal to your Wisdom bonus. In addition, you may use the monk class's flurry of blows ability to make an additional attack in each round. You gain these abilities so long as you do not wear armour. Even the lightest protection, such as padded or leather armour, is too bulky and restrictive to allow you to fight with your new martial arts skills.\n\nWhile under the influence of this spell, you may use unarmed attacks to deliver touch spells such as *chill touch*. Make an attack as normal. On a hit, you deal your improved unarmed damage in addition to the touch spell's damage. If your attack misses your opponent's normal AC but hits his touch one, you deal damage only with your touch spell.\n\n*Source: The Quintessential Wizard p. 78*\n\n## Replicate Casting (Age of Freedom)\n\n*9th level transmutation*\n\n**Components:** V, S  \n**Casting Time:** 1 round; see text  \n**Range:** See text  \n**Effect:** One spell or spell-like ability  \n**Duration:** See text  \n**Saving Throw:** See text  \n**Spell Resistance:** See text\n\n*The enemy mage raises her hands, and a cone of swirling, multicolored winds appears at her fingertips. Then she laughs and says, \"Can you do that?\" You smile and reply, \"I can now.\"*\n\nYou duplicate the effect of any one spell or spell-like ability you have seen within the last round. This spell can duplicate only spells and spell-like abilities of 8th level or lower. This duplication functions like the ability of a *wish* spell to duplicate another spell, except that it is not limited by type of spell (divine or arcane) or by what school the effect is from. If the casting time of the spell you observed is greater than 1 round, the casting time of this spell is increased to the same.\n\nA duplicated spell or spell-like ability functions as if you had the appropriate spell prepared and were casting it yourself. If the spell or ability has an XP cost, you must pay that XP cost. If the spell has a costly material component, you must provide that component or pay an additional XP cost equal to the gold piece value of that component divided by 5.\n\n*Source: Spell Compendium p. 173*\n\n## Suggestion (Age of Freedom)\n\n*3rd level enchantment*\n\n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 levels)  \n**Target:** One living creature  \n**Components:** V, M  \n**Duration:** 1 hour per level or until completed  \n**Saving Throw:** Wisdom negates  \n**Spell Resistance:** Yes\n\nThe character influences the actions of the enchanted creature by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable.\n\nThe suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what he was asked to do. The character can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell expires, the activity is not performed.\n\nA very reasonable suggestion causes the save to be made with a penalty (such as 1, 2, etc.) at the discretion of the GM. \n\n*Source: D&D 3rd Edition Player's Handbook*  \nhttps://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/3e_SRD:Suggestion\n\n## Tenacious Dispelling (Age of Freedom)\n\n*3rd level abjuration*\n\n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. per level)  \n**Target or Area:** One creature or object, or 20-ft.-radius burst  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n**Saving Throw:** None  \n**Spell Resistance:** No\n\n*A wave of your hand sweeps away some of the magical effects on your target, but a surge of energy within you wants another try.*\n\nThis spell functions as a targeted *[dispel magic](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/3e_SRD:Dispel_Magic)*.\n\nIf you cast *tenacious dispelling* again before the end of your enxt turn, the second casting can function either as a targeted or area *dispel magic*, and you gain a +2 bonus on dispel checks made as part of the spell.\n\n*Source: Complete Mage p. 119*\n\n## Wall of Greater Dispel Magic (Age of Freedom)\n\n*8th level abjuration*\n\n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Components:** V, S, DF  \n**Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 levels)  \n**Effect:** A straight wall whose area is up to one 10-ft. square per level  \n**Duration:** 1 minute per level  \n**Saving Throw:** None  \n**Spell Resistance:** No\n\n*You cast the spell and a translucent wall springs up, a shimmering field of faded colors that swirls and merges with itself like the surface of a soap bubble, pulsing with strong, malignant shades than spin and twist into each other.*\n\nThis spell creates a transparent, permeable barrier. Anyone passing through it becomes the target of a [greater dispel magic](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Greater_Dispel_Magic) effect at your caster level. A summoned creature targeted in this way can be dispelled by the effect. A *wall of greater dispel magic* cannot be seen or felt by ordinary means, or even with a *see invisibility* spell. *Detect magic* indicates the presence of the effect, and *true seeing* reveals its presence.\n\n*Source: Spell Compendium p. 234*\n\n## War Mastery (Age of Freedom)\n\n*3rd level divination*\n\n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Target:** Creature touched  \n**Duration:** 1 minute per level  \n**Saving Throw:** Wisdom negates (harmless)  \n**Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)\n\nThis spell grants the touched creature insight into an advanced combat technique.
