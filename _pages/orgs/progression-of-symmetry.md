The Progression of Symmetry is a monastic order practicing the Way of the Four Elements. There are ~50 initiates who live there, and four masters. The monks believe in keeping a detached perspective from the material world.

* There is power in the balance of elements.
* There is power in the balance of mori (dark/moon/yin) and kalina (light/sun/yang).
* [Sehanine](../dossiers/sehanine) is goddess of the moon; [Pelor](../dossiers/pelor) is god of the sun.
* The monks are sometimes called on to mediate disputes between clans.

The order has four masters, one for each element. The current masters are:

* **Grandmaster of Winds:** [Ou-sh-](../dossiers/oush), an aarakocra.
* **Master of Earth:** [Ceowyn Mandragoran](../dossiers/ceowyn-mandragoran), an elf.
* **Master of Water:** [Sonan the Scholar](../dossiers/sonan-the-scholar), a [samsaran](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/uncommon-races/arg-samsaran).
* **Master of Fire:** [Kára Halfdandóttir](../dossiers/kara-halfdandottir), a dragonborn valkyrie.

The monastery is nestled atop the tallest peak of the Cliffs of Transcendence, known as the Zenithal Summit. It is this point around which legends are crafted. Sometimes people jump. They say that if your heart is pure, you will not die, but instead you will transcend, and your most ardent wish will be granted.
