Trade, Enforcement, Arbitration and Mediation (TEAM) is the diplomatic arm of
the A.C., facilitating diplomatic relations and fair trade between the nations.
It enforces its
[arbitration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_arbitration)
decisions, as well as international regulations, largely via threat of trade
sanctions and embargoes, should a nation fail to comply. Which so far has been
rare.
