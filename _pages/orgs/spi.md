### Allies and informants

Mallory has a network of informants, though it is much reduced in recent times,
due to the calamity that recently befell the SPI. Many are afraid to be
associated with an organization which seems under direct assault from powerful
and mysterious forces.

Still, the SPI agents are working to rebuild this network of informants, who
include:

* [Contessa Alyssa Morvain](../dossiers/contessa-alyssa-morvain)
* [Rubinia Elka](../dossiers/rubinia-elka)
* [Rollomorphus Rockwell](../dossiers/rollomorphus-rockwell)
* [Linistreya Grumbletuft](../dossiers/linistreya-grumbletuft)

**Cognitutus Board of Regents.** The current Board consists of
[Garl Glittergold](../dossiers/garl-glittergold),
[Rimona Kwalish](../dossiers/rimona-kwalish),
[Schnartank Bombardine](../dossiers/schnartank-bombardine), and
[Aurora Damasca](../dossiers/aurora-damasca). Aside from Bombardine,
they supported the [SPI's mission to the ocean depths](../events/case-11) to
confront the [aboleth](../dossiers/aboleths) threat to
[the city](../locales/cognitutus), with Kwalish lending them her twinked out
submarine, and Aurora accompanying them as a munitions expert.

### Criminals and villains

The SPI has faced many threats throughout its 50 year existence,
and brought many criminals to justice. Most recently, those include:
