This military order of paladins maintains order and peace in the [Radiant Union of Pelor](../locales/rup).

Their hierarchy includes:

* Sunblades - elite paladins who serve as personal guards to high officials
* Dawnguards - paladins who maintain order in cities
* Lightweavers - battle clerics who support military operations
* Duskwatchers - scouts and rangers who patrol borders

Their equipment features polished bronze, gold accents, and sun imagery. Their armor is designed to reflect sunlight brilliantly, serving both practical (heat management) and symbolic purposes.
