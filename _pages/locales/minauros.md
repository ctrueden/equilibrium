An economic powerhouse steeped in ramshackle chaos, the island of Minauros serves as Trell's international commerce and financial hub, where ships laden with goods arrive and depart in constant motion. Despite Minauros's muddy and barren landscape, the harbor teems with activity: shipping magnates, merchants, smugglers, and black market operators all conduct business in close proximity, their interests overlapping in murky ways.

[Mammon](../dossiers/mammon)'s greed drives cutthroat trade wars and debt slavery through credit crystals—a system of indentured servitude where souls are "minted" and "processed" as currency. The island is the most cosmopolitan of all Trell's islands, attracting foreign traders and ambitious merchants. Yet beneath the bustling commercial facade lies the grinding poverty of those who lost in Mammon's ruthless game.
