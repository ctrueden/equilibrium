A great city built by gnomes, which disappeared during the War of Countless Dead. Once on the west coast of Aecus, the story goes that it was reclaimed by the sea: the coastline collapsed, and the city sank. Some believe the event was an act of war, others a punishment by the gods. But no one living then has clear memories of exactly what happened. Since then, gnomes have been few and far between.

* **Population:** Before its disappearance, Cognitutus was inhabited almost exclusively by gnomes, though the occasional off-race tinkerer would settle down there, starry eyed, hoping to absorb a fraction of the gnomish fevered insight into technology.
* **Government:** [Meritocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy). The city was governed by an elected Board of [Regents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regent#Other_uses_of_the_word) who each served for one year, and were not eligible for subsequent reelection.
* **Cities and culture:** Cognitutus was famed for being a wondrous hub of innovation and invention. New creations are a badge of pride for every gnome—whereas repeating the same endeavor, no matter how successful or useful it was before, is generally considered a waste of time. Gnomes invent unique and incredible machines, mechanisms and magic, but almost never mass produce their creations. Many times, they couldn’t even if they wanted to, their work having been produced in a flash of inspiration or rare lucky break.
* **Deities worshipped:** The twin goddesses [Erathis](../dossiers/erathis) and [Avandra](../dossiers/avandra) are often regarded by gnomes as two forces in balance, each stronger because of the other’s influence. Some gnomes even believe they are two faces of the same goddess who they call [Ioun](../dossiers/ioun), goddess of knowledge, prophecy and skill.

## The true fate of the city

The city sinking into the sea was planned by the gnomes, to escape the escalating conflict of the war. Many of the city’s most talented inventors worked for years to design underwater containment and propulsion systems, so that the city could become a self-sustaining mobile undersea bubble.

The bubble is cloaked from the outside with an invisibility spell; it is mobile via four gigantic rotating turrets; and roving a few miles away from the bubble is the WOW, a jumbo sized [will-o’-wisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will-o%27-wisp_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)) whose job it is to draw undersea travelers away from the city toward shinier waters.

Residents of the city subsist largely on undersea flora and fauna. There are many gnomish gatherers dedicated to harvesting the sea life as the city moves around, using unique underwater crafts of their own design. These “farmers” do need defensive capabilities, to avoid the myriad dangers of undersea life outside the city walls. The city’s propulsion is fueled by undersea minerals, which the farmers also harvest. To renew the air supply, the city must come to the surface once every few years.

The city requires substantial resources to keep working, so it rarely doubles back to already harvested areas. Thus, as the years go by, the gnomes find themselves further and further west, deeper and deeper into the vastness of the Infinite Ocean...
