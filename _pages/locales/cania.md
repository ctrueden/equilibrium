An island of living cold where arcane research thrives in frozen isolation. Cania serves as Trell's center for magical innovation and dangerous experimentation. Universities, laboratories, and enchanting facilities dot the frozen landscape, where researchers investigate cursed artifacts, develop new magical techniques, and push the boundaries of what is possible through magic.

[Mephistopheles](../dossiers/mephistopheles), embodying cold calculation and forbidden knowledge, presides over these endeavors. The island attracts ambitious mages, alchemists, and researchers willing to conduct experiments that would be banned elsewhere. It is here that magical items are refined, poisons are perfected, and cursed byproducts of extraction processes that no one dares speak of are peddled to the unwary.
