> But one of the whole mammoth-brood still kept  
> His sov'reignty, and rule, and majesty;—  
> Blazing Hyperion on his orbed fire  
> Still sat, still snuff'd the incense, teeming up  
> From man to the sun's God; yet unsecure:  
> For as among us mortals omens drear  
> Fright and perplex, so also shuddered he—  
> Not at dog's howl, or gloom-bird's hated screech,  
> Or the familiar visiting of one  
> Upon the first toll of his passing-bell,  
> Or prophesyings of the midnight lamp;  
> But horrors, portion'd to a giant nerve,  
> Oft made Hyperion ache. His palace bright  
> Bastion'd with pyramids of glowing gold.  
> And touch'd with shade of bronzed obelisks,  
> Glar'd a blood-red through all its thousand courts,  
> Arches, and domes, and fiery galleries;  
> And all its curtains of Aurorian clouds  
> Flush'd angerly: while sometimes eagle's wings,  
> Unseen before by Gods or wondering men,  
> Darken'd the place; and neighing steeds were heard,  
> Not heard before by Gods or wondering men.  
> Also, when he would taste the spicy wreaths  
> Of incense, breath'd aloft from sacred hills,  
> Instead of sweets, his ample palate took  
> Savour of poisonous brass and metal sick:  
> And so, when harbour'd in the sleepy west,  
> After the full completion of fair day,—  
> For rest divine upon exalted couch  
> And slumber in the arms of melody,  
> He pac'd away the pleasant hours of ease  
> With stride colossal, on from hall to hall;  
> While far within each aisle and deep recess,  
> His winged minions in close clusters stood,  
> Amaz'd and full of fear; like anxious men  
> Who on wide plains gather in panting troops,  
> When earthquakes jar their battlements and towers.
