Deep in [Selva](selva), the rainforest becomes hotter, thicker, darker, and more infused with deep and ancient elemental and [fey](../creatures/fey) magics. The boundary of this jungle is the ultimate hunting ground for bold Selvan tribes, but even the most hardened warrior explorers dare not delve too deep&mdash;those who do are never seen again, or else are driven mad by what they see, raving of abominations.
