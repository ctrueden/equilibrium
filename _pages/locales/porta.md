title: Porta
---

In the city of Porta, dragonborn soldiers keep the peace.

* Interior of the city is divided into zones by clan.
* There are 11 zones: metallic, chromatic and motley.
* Many dragonborn want to live as close to Skyrealm as possible.
* Any who fall from the cliffs are caught by the Great Buffer, an endless wind ward that prevents people from traversing too far downward into the shimmering haze.
