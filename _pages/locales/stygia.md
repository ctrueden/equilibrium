A frozen hellscape of ice, snow, and violent seas, Stygia is the poorest of Trell's nine islands, a land of harsh maritime labor and bitter survival. The Great Sea surrounding it creates crucial shipping routes connecting all of Trell's islands to the wider world, making Stygia a vital nexus of commerce despite its brutal conditions.

[Levistus](../dossiers/levistus), bound in ice as eternal punishment, rules from frozen isolation. The island has become a dumping ground for the system's failures—refugees fleeing violence, laborers who lost in the cutthroat game, the desperate and dispossessed. Slums sprawl across the frozen wastes, hidden from the view of Trell's elite who profit from the shipping routes that make Stygia strategically invaluable.
