Ancient underwater city of the [merfolk](../creatures/merfolk).

Millennia ago, the corrupted sahaguin, led by an evil sorceress, attacked with
the fierce Dragon Turtle Vorltrarr, decimating much of the city. The SPI are
the ones from the other side of the Waters of Antiguaâ€”the ones prophesied to
save them!

Co-ruled by the brotherkings [Aquarmand](../dossiers/aquarmand) and
[Harnaqua](../dossiers/harnaqua).
