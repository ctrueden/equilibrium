At the northern edge of the world stand the Cliffs of Transcendence, a mountain range beyond which there is nothing but an open expanse of sky. Masses of earth dot the skies beyond that, though; the largest of these “sky islands” is Aether, the Azure City. South of the cliffs lies the Ventosa Flatland, a windy steppe, home to the two largest cities of Zephyr: Dono and Prendo.

* **Population:** The most numerous citizens of this land are the [dragonborn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonborn), a race of dragon humanoids. Dragons dwell here too as a ruling class, but are nonetheless incredibly rare, numbering in the hundreds at most.
* Government: [Confederacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederation). Fifteen city-states, each governed by a [great wyrm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)#Dragon_classification).
* **Cities and culture:**
  * Dono is the bastion of the [metallic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_dragon) dragonborn, tolerant of outsiders.
  * Prendo is harsher with a martial atmosphere, and home to [chromatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_dragon) dragonborn. It lies on the north bank of the great lake Placitum.
  * Porta is a city built into the Cliffs of Transcendance, home to various dragonborn and many avian creatures.
  * Aether, the Azure City in the sky, is more mysterious—few land-dwellers have ever set foot there. It is rumored to be home to rare [gem dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gem_dragon) and dragonborn with strange mental powers.

### Society

Zephyr is a martial society, divided into 16 clans, which are often in conflict with each other. What follows is a summary of the clans, including racial stereotypes.

* [Metallic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_dragon)
  * Brass (sleep gas, fire line)
  * Bronze (repulsion gas, lightning)
  * Copper (slow gas, acid line)
  * Silver (paralyzation gas, frost)
  * Gold (weakening gas, fire)
* [Chromatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_dragon)
  * White (frost) - feral
  * Black (acid) - vile-tempered, cruel, bargain-loving
  * Green (acidic gas) - cunning, duplicitous, magical
  * Blue (lightning) - mocking, manipulative, tricky
  * Red (fire) - disdainful and avaricious
* [Gem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gem_dragon)
  * Crystal (blinding light line) - friendly and sentimental
  * Emerald (wind burst) - reclusive and jealous
  * Sapphire (panicking sound) - militaristic and territorial
  * Topaz (dehydration cone) - isolationist and xenophobic
  * Amethyst (force line) - detached and arrogant
* Motley - those who cannot fit into one of the “pure” clans.

There are also rarer dragon types, which do not have dedicated clans:

* Metallic: [Adamantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_dragon#Adamantine_dragon), [Cobalt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_dragon#Cobalt_dragon), [Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_dragon#Mercury_dragon), [Mithral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_dragon#Mithral_dragon), [Orium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_dragon#Orium_dragon), [Steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_dragon#Steel_dragon)
* Chromatic: [Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_dragon#Brown_dragon), [Orange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_dragon#Orange_dragon), [Purple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_dragon#Purple_dragon), [Yellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_dragon#Yellow_dragon), [Grey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_dragon#Grey_dragon)
* Gem: [Obsidian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gem_dragon#Obsidian_dragon)

Finally, there are Clanless dragons: those who have been expelled from their clan.

### The aarakocra

The [aarakocra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aarakocra) are a bird-like race that keeps watch against the gargoyles which emerge from the Howling Gyre, an endless storm of mighty winds and lashing rains north of Skyrealm.
