At the northern edge of the world stand the Cliffs of Transcendence, a mountain range beyond which there is nothing but an open expanse of sky. Masses of earth dot the skies beyond that, though; the largest of these "sky islands" is Aether, the Azure City. South of the cliffs lies the Ventosa Flatland, a windy steppe, home to the two largest cities of Zephyr: Dono and Prendo.

* **Population:** The most numerous citizens of this land are the [dragonborn](../creatures/dragonborn), a race of dragon-like [bipeds](../glossary#bipedal). Dragons dwell here too as a ruling class, but are nonetheless incredibly rare, numbering in the hundreds at most.
* Government: [Confederacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederation). Fifteen city-states, each governed by a [great wyrm](../creatures/dragons).
* **Cities and culture:**
  * Dono is the bastion of the [metallic](../creatures/dragons#metallic) dragonborn, tolerant of outsiders.
  * Prendo is harsher with a martial atmosphere, and home to [chromatic](../creatures/dragons#chromatic) dragonborn. It lies on the north bank of the great lake Placitum.
  * Porta is a city built into the Cliffs of Transcendance, home to various dragonborn and many avian creatures.
  * Aether, the Azure City in the sky, is more mysteriousâ€”few land-dwellers have ever set foot there. It is rumored to be home to rare [gem dragons](../creatures/dragons#gem) and dragonborn with strange mental powers.

### Society

Zephyr is a martial society, divided into 16 clans, which are often in conflict with each other. What follows is a summary of the clans, including racial stereotypes.

* [Metallic](../creatures/dragons#metallic)
  * Brass (sleep gas, fire line)
  * Bronze (repulsion gas, lightning)
  * Copper (slow gas, acid line)
  * Silver (paralyzation gas, frost)
  * Gold (weakening gas, fire)
* [Chromatic](../creatures/dragons#chromatic)
  * White (frost) - feral
  * Black (acid) - vile-tempered, cruel, bargain-loving
  * Green (acidic gas) - cunning, duplicitous, magical
  * Blue (lightning) - mocking, manipulative, tricky
  * Red (fire) - disdainful and avaricious
* [Gem](../creatures/dragons#gem)
  * Crystal (blinding light line) - friendly and sentimental
  * Emerald (wind burst) - reclusive and jealous
  * Sapphire (panicking sound) - militaristic and territorial
  * Topaz (dehydration cone) - isolationist and xenophobic
  * Amethyst (force line) - detached and arrogant
* Motley - those who cannot fit into one of the "pure" clans.

There are also rarer dragon types, which do not have dedicated clans:

* Metallic: [Adamantine](https://dungeonsdragons.fandom.com/wiki/Adamantine_dragon), Cobalt, Mercury, Mithral, Orium, Steel
* Chromatic: Brown, Orange, [Purple](https://dungeonsdragons.fandom.com/wiki/Purple_dragon), Yellow, Gray
* Gem: Obsidian

Finally, there are Clanless dragons: those who have been expelled from their clan.

### The aarakocra

The [aarakocra](../creatures/aarakocra) are a bird-like race that keeps watch against the [gargoyles](../creatures/gargoyles) which emerge from the Howling Gyre, an endless storm of mighty winds and lashing rains north of Skyrealm.
