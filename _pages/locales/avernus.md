A volcanic island transformed into an industrial heartland. Avernus is the engine of Trell's economy, where raw materials are extracted and processed into finished goods through brutal, relentless labor. The landscape itself—jagged obsidian and quartz crystals jutting from barren hills and lava-scarred terrain—serves as both resource and hazard, cutting and slicing any who move too carelessly.

The island is controlled by competing megacorps fighting for manufacturing supremacy, all operating under the watchful eye of [Zariel](../dossiers/zariel), whose military discipline translates into rigid worker hierarchies and merciless efficiency. The obsidian and crystal landscape literally powers Trell's economy; these materials flow to every other island for refinement, sale, or weaponization, or use as fuel.
