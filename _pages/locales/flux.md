title: The Flux
---

* The Temple of Symmetry was ultimately sucked into the unstable vortex which was created when Vondal disrupted the Zenithal Summit. Sonan the Scholar is dead, from the wounds he suffered curing Vondal. Ceowyn wants a place where he can meditate in seclusion, as recompense.
* Flux spot growing where Brian was.
* Flux spot where first SPI HQ was.
* Flux spot where Stormherd camp was.
* Flux spot where circus was in the RUP.

Case 07:
* Mallory tells the party that several new areas of Flux have emerged, including one where the Stormherd camp was, and another at the old SPI headquarters under the Mountain. He says that their colleague Audreth has been dispatched to Euphoria to research ways to combat their growth. Mallory stresses that the SPIâ€™s new top priority is to *prevent*, or failing that, *contain* explosions of wild magic from now on (e.g., like Cal tried to do by destroying to the Flux weapon), until a way is found to reverse the Flux at these hotspots.
