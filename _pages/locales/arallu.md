A terrifying undead realm to the southwest, about which little is known.

* **Population:** It is said that the land now called Arallu once had a different name which has been forgotten.
* **Government:** No one knows for certain amongst the living, and the undead diplomats of Arallu reveal little. But it is rumored that there are three rulers of a vile triumvirate, each of whom commands obedience from creatures under their respective dominions.
* **Cities and culture:** The rumor is that three cities of once-breathtaking beauty are now connected into a sprawling necropolis that covers the heart of the land. But none have seen such firsthand and returned with any proof.
* **Deities worshipped:** Unknownâ€”the undead of Arallu do not speak of such things. But deities known to be associated with undeath are [Vecna](/dossiers/vecna) and [Nerull](/dossiers/nerull).
