title: The Deepwood

Beyond the [Estanesse](../locales/estanesse) and the [World Tree](../relics/yggdrasil), the [forest of Elyria](../locales/elyria) becomes more primordial, with thickening Feymist harboring ancient and elusive [fey](../creatures/fey) powers beyond mortal comprehension. Even the [elves](../creatures/elves) and other fey creatures who are most attuned to this way of being do not dare make their homes too deep, for fear of it warping their minds into new alien identities.
