The seat of absolute power and the true heart of Trell. Nessus is an exclusive enclave reserved for the ultra-wealthy and most powerful entities in the archipelago. While the other islands serve specific economic functions—manufacturing, trade, law, research—Nessus exists to consolidate and celebrate power itself.

Malsheem, the grand citadel of [Asmodeus](../dossiers/asmodeus), dominates the island. Gated communities and private estates house the C-suite executives, megacorp oligarchs, and archfiends themselves. This is not a place of work or commerce, but rather a symbol of final victory—the destination where the winners of Trell's ruthless game retire to enjoy the spoils of their conquest. Here, luxury is absolute and the law itself bends to the will of those who have accumulated enough power.
