title: Triumph
---

A city in the [Radiant Union of Pelor](rup) that is very close to the [Flux](flux). Its construction was a rare collaboration between the [Luminous Defenders](../orgs/luminous-defenders), the warlocks of [Trell](trell), and a guild of wild magic sorcerers, as an experiment to see whether the Flux could be driven back by magical means.
