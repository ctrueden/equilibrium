Officially a mining district, the island of Malbolge is the seat of Trell's criminal underworld—a parallel economy running beneath and intertwined with every legitimate business on the other islands. The black markets here deal in everything: illegal goods, stolen artifacts, enslaved labor, and darker commodities that dare not be named in polite company.

[Glasya](../dossiers/glasya) recently ousted the Hag Countess Malagard and consolidated her power. Hags remain deeply embedded in Malbolge's power structure, conducting their own commerce with [Grohnea](../dossiers/grohnea), a witch who harvests and sells soul larvae: twisted beings that are sometimes resold to [Stygia](../locales/stygia) to add to [Levistus](../dossiers/levistus)'s centuries-old stockpile. The official mining operations are merely a thin veil over the true business: slavery, extortion, and the trafficking of souls themselves.
