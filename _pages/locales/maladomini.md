A byzantine labyrinth of information where every deed, contract, and document of the Trell archipelago eventually finds its way to an archive. Maladomini is the heart of Trell's bureaucratic machinery, where permits are filed, NDAs are archived, contracts are recorded, and the paper trail of commerce is meticulously maintained.

Grenpoli, known as the City of Diplomacy, serves as neutral ground for diplomatic negotiations and the seat of the Trell Political School (TPS)—a prestigious institution that trains diplomats, lawyers, and arbitrators. [Baalzebul](../dossiers/baalzebul) profits enormously from the arbitration industry, as the endless NDAs and arbitration clauses embedded in Trell's commercial landscape mean disputes flow constantly to his courts. Every legal conflict, every contractual disagreement, every corporate negotiation that requires a neutral arbiter ends up on his desk, making Maladomini extraordinarily lucrative despite its soul-crushing bureaucratic façade.
