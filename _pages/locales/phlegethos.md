The island of Phlegethos is the judicial center of Trell, where the fates of corporations rise and fall through legal warfare. Abriymoch, with its iconic Crystalline Palace, dominates the skyline—a gleaming monument to wealth and power. This is where the boardrooms meet, where contracts are signed, where empires crumble under the weight of judicial verdicts.

Life on Phlegethos swings wildly between ecstatic highs and excruciating lows. A victorious megacorp might celebrate a landmark court ruling while another files for bankruptcy in the same hour. [Belial](../dossiers/belial) and [Fierna](../dossiers/fierna) oversee this arena of legal combat, profiting from the endless cycle of corporate conflict. The island is ringed with skyscrapers and gated wealth enclaves, where massive inequality is enshrined in the very architecture.
