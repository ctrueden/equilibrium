A paranoia-driven fortress-metropolis island so tremendous and sprawling it could be infinite—a labyrinthine maze that defies possibility, where one could wander the streets forever and get nowhere. Several miles tall and hundreds of miles across, Dis is both prison and commerce hub, where every transaction is logged, every movement tracked, every conversation monitored through the technomagic networks maintained by Omni Analytics.

The island serves as the middle-class heartland of Trell, where regular citizens live and work as small business owners, service workers, and retail merchants. Competition is fierce, surveillance is absolute, and the constant paranoia creates a hyper-competitive corporate culture where information is currency and trust is a luxury no one can afford.
