These swamp lands, which border the [ocean](ocean)'s south edge, are not very pleasant. Some [brave souls](../dossiers/grohnea) do make their homes there, because the [vampires](../creatures/undead#vampires) don't enjoy the swamp either, and it keeps out the [zombies](../creatures/undead#zombies) pretty well&mdash;they get stuck in the muck. But really, why would you do that to yourself? Really? You hate other people that much? I guess some people just need their privacy!
