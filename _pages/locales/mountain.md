title: Dwarves - The Mountain and the Veldt
---

**The Mountain and the Veldt.** [Dwarves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)) dwell beneath a colossal volcano they uncreatively call the Great Mountain, and farm the surrounding Veldt lands. Actually, the dwarves have had quite a few names for their mountain throughout history, but as clans rose and fell, the name kept being changed. Now it is a sore point for the dwarves—so as a compromise, most simply call it “the Mountain” to avoid incurring the ire of their fellows. Plus, foreigners always mangle dwarven pronunciation anyway.

* **Population:** The dwarves are hardy, practical, and many in number. Non-dwarves sometimes join dwarven farming communities, but very rarely make their home in the tunnels of the Mountain itself.
* **Government:** [Patriarchal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy) [monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy). The King of the Dwarves rules justly, with seven High Clans serving as his advisers and implementers of dwarven law. (In dwarven society, any adult member of each Clan can act as legal representative for that Clan; those who bring dishonor upon their clan are excommunicated.)
* **Cities and culture:**
  * Mountain dwarves live underground, in the mighty and vast labyrinth of the Mountain—its tunnels warded and reinforced against eruption by dwarven mages who claim their work protects not only their people, but all surface dwellers against the raging and all-consuming fires of the underworld. The Mountain has brought the dwarves great wealth—they have thoroughly excavated its many precious ores, metals and gems.
  * Hill dwarves live above ground, either in the foothills of the Mountain, or in the flatlands of the Veldt to the west in small villages. Despite the Veldt’s intense summer heat, the hill dwarves grow many bountiful crops by employing secret dwarven farming techniques which they jealously protect, enabling them to feed their prosperous people despite their large numbers.
* **Deities worshipped:**
  * [Moradin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moradin) (LG; Knowledge, War): god of creation
  * [Pelor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelor) (NG; Life, Light): god of the sun and agriculture
* **Neighbors:** N: RUP, S: Selva, W: Flux, E: The Everburn.

### The Seven Clans

There are seven dwarven High Clans:

* **Aldrimor** – Brave, honorable and humble leaders.
* **Balderk** – Hard-working and productive farmers.
* **Corbinic** – Sticklers for the law. Previous king Kaladrin came from this clan.
* **Dungart** – Stout and vigorous defenders. Protect Veldt villages; defend the tunnels from threats.
* **Elka** – Intellectual magicians. Strengthen tunnel integrity, research agriculture gems.
* **Fireforge** – Smiths and builders.
* **Greyshore** – Diplomats and mediators. Current king Durak comes from this clan.
