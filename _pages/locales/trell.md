A fiendish island territory off the northwestern coast.

* **Population:** Trell has a mixed population with an extreme degree of [class inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_conflict).
* **Government:** [Military autocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship). Trell has nine islands, each of which is ruled by an archfiend, with the largest island occupied by the archfiend [Asmodeus](../dossiers/asmodeus).
* **Cities and culture:** While the government of Trell is oppressive by the standards of most other nations, it is nonetheless a haven for tieflings (a [bipedal](../glossary#bipedal) race cursed by an ancient contract with fiends). The warlocks of Trell, who have made pacts with the archdevils who rule the islands, enforce the law. The nine city-state islands are:
  * Avernus, ruled by [Zariel](https://dungeonsdragons.fandom.com/wiki/Zariel).
  * Dis, ruled by Dispater.
  * Minauros, ruled by Mammon.
  * Phlegethos, ruled by Belial and Fierna.
  * Stygia, ruled by Levistus.
  * Malbolge, ruled by Glasya.
  * Maladomini, ruled by Baalzebul.
  * Cania, ruled by [Mephistopheles](../dossiers/mephistopheles).
  * Nessus, home to Asmodeus's grand citadel of Malsheem.
* **Deities worshipped:** Religion is forbidden in Trell. But a few illicitly worship:
  * [Melora](../dossiers/melora) (N; Nature, Tempest): goddess of wilderness and the sea
