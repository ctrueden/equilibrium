A stone sacred to the [dwarven people](../races/dwarves).

Legend says it was forged by [Moradin](../dossiers/moradin), god of dwarves,
and used to fuel the fire at the heart of the Great Mountain.

Two months ago, it was in the SPI's possession. They were studying it. Then the SPI exploded in flames one nightâ€”it may or may not have been the Stone which was responsible... afterward, the Arkenstone was gone.
