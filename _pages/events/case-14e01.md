Over the next few days, [Mallory](../dossiers/mallory) (the real one!) and [Cassandra](../dossiers/cassandra) work to get the SPI HQ back into shape.

* All field agents are called back to base for an all-staff meeting on Woodsday, Vis 03. This includes:

  - [Rain](../dossiers/rain)
  - [Squeaks McKraken](../dossiers/squeaks-mckraken)
  - [Lawrence Feathersworth](../dossiers/lawrence-feathersworth)
  - [Victor Rocksmith](../dossiers/victor-rocksmith)

* Meanwhile, our SPI agent heroes have two days off: Vis 01 and Vis 02. Or they can help rebuild HQ.

Some notable things relating our heroes:

- [Cal](../dossiers/cal) feels something has changed about the Arkenstab. He feels it pulsing with more power than ever, but he also feels a shock of momentary cold every time he grasps it. Cold like vengeance.
- [Bec](../dossiers/bec)'s father [Letharil Galere](../dossiers/letharil-galere) stops by the SPI. To thank her again. He entrusts her with [Sartus](../dossiers/sartus-morningdew)'s spellbooks.
- [Freki](../dossiers/freki) has time to craft more special arrows.
- [Oz](../dossiers/oz)'s contacts confirm that they sent him the monkey statue. Signed, sealed, and delivered to SPI administrator Cassandra.
- [Callie](../dossiers/callie) has a clairvoyant episode.

At the all-staff meeting: various agents share information about current events:

- In the absence of leadership, McKraken, Feathersworth, and Rocksmith have started to establish SPI outputs in three of the nations: Squeaks under the Mountain, Featherworth in Reena'seere. Rocksmith in Trell.

- Cassandra remembers what happened to her: she and Mallory (Eeoram, really) were back at the base, trying to deal with [the Breach](the-breach), when they were ambushed by the [Malosi](../orgs/malosi). Before she could react, she was slain by [Andalla](../dossiers/andalla) the dragon shaman. Cassandra felt Andalla pulling at her spirit, trying to consume her, but she managed to flee into the nearby monkey statue, which she sensed could house souls. But once inside, she realized the soul of a monkey was already within, and they began to comingle. Cassandra remembers being inside the statue, her consciousness fading, but striving with all her will to drive the intruders as far away as she could. She doesn't know what happened to Eeoram, but she remembers him being there with her right before the ambush...

- Squeaks McKraken has been working on a case in the dwarven lands:
  - Dwarves aren't fighting goblins anymore because goblins stopped coming.
  - When dwarves investigated, they found karach had spread up from the tunnel depths: a "super bloom" of karach!
  - The karach is unstable, and Flux oozes in various places. Squeaks was unable to delve deeper on his own, but he was able to connect the source to the old SPI HQ, behind the sealed off stone wall.

- Lawrence Feathersworth has been in contact with [Arallu](../locales/arallu) about an incident that occurred in [Sepulchralis](../locales/sepulchralis), the underground Arallan necropolis.While agents of Arallu are the ones who contacted him asking for the SPI's help, he has not yet been successful in arranging passage to Arallu to actually investigate what happened. But he knows some details of the incident:
  - [Evershroud Manor](../locales/evershroud-manor), the primary residence of [Timor Invictus](../dossiers/timor-invictus), suddenly exploded with positive energy on Rixa 25. It is believed that Invictus was inside at the time, and he has not been heard from since.
  - The undead sent in some living mortals to investigate, but none returned.
  - The undead themselves cannot enter, for fearing of being quickly destroyed by the positive energy suffusing the place.

- Victor Rocksmith has also been in diplomacy mode:
  - He has spoken with agents of [Saint Benedor](../dossiers/benedor), who wants the SPI to ensure that an unnatural hurricane from Trell reaches Oasis, to rejuvenate the land, and insists that the SPI owes a debt to his nation for their actions regarding the Cornucopia.
  - But the dragons of Skyrealm have pledged to unravel the hurricane using air countermagic, and have forbidden the SPI from interfering. It is a brewing international incident.
  - Rocksmith is not sure what to do, but he was able to trace the origin of the hurricane back to a magical lighthouse on the shores of Trell...

- Rain has been chilling at Vondal's house in Vondal's bathrobes. :-D

Feathersworth has arranged for the Arallan representatives to meet at the SPI outpost in Reena'seere.

Mallory approves Cal & company's request to join Feathersworth for the Arallu meeting. But he warns them that that there is a very delicate balance of power in Arallu, and that the actions the agents take could disrupt that balance and lead to world instability.
