1. Aurora hooks up the party with some guns. How the guns work:

  1. [Rate of fire](http://www.d20modernpf.com/wealth-and-equipment/weapons/#Firearm_Rate_of_Fire)
  2. “Toasty” Flamethrower - mounted on the Crab - 3d6 fire in 15' cone
  3. M2HB heavy machine gun - mounted in weapon port on exterior - 1d12+3 per slug
  4. M72A3 LAW torpedo launcher - occupying one passenger spot - 10d6

2. There is not enough room in the sub for all 8 people as well as all the guns. We leave Rollo behind to make room for the flamethrower. He gives Callie his blessing.
3. Swarms of creatures, and electrical firestorm/battle at the main gate. To avoid that, as well as the “poop tubes,” we decide to use the passwall module. We are sure it will be fine—but Callie gives Oz her inspiration and Vondal uses magic to boost his skill so we don’t all die.
4. We barely make it to the water.
5. Some sort of evil mental tendril is leading us to our doom. The End of All Things.
6. After several days in the sub, a large bluish floating humanoid-ish being appears — a Water Genie (Marid), who warns us to turn back or DIE!!!
7. After being informed the party carries the Hornblade, Benirree the Elegant says it has no choice but to help, giving Vondal and Callie detect evil and good at will; Callie invisibility 1/day; Vondal control water 1/day. Benirree plane shifts away.
8. The party continues on their ill-advised journey for 12 more hours, till the water becomes more sludgelike, more difficult to navigate. Aurora’s continued sanity seems questionable.
9. Bec ventures out in the Crab, hits the flamethrower and sees the void of nothing.
10. After redocking the Crab, and traveling forward for another couple of minutes, the party realizes they have arrived at a non-place: a football-shaped Void around which reality itself bends. There is a crack leading in, which looks like this:
11. Those who are strong of mind realize that the city is an ancient phantom, with no bottom:
12. The party takes 20 minutes to buff, staring directly into the void while doing so.
13. The party heads into the sketchy chasm. They see a temple-looking thing floating in the non-reality underneath (see right).
14. There is a perfect place to dock the Streamcutter, which appears to be the sole obvious entrance into the temple. Everything is perfectly safe.
15. Oz, Freki and Cal scout into the temple. They begin to understand the layout of the temple. They start heading back to rejoin the others—but they are ambushed by sharks!
