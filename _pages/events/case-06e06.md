* Sean separated the belts on his front right tire. He also bent three of his rims.
* Then we started gaming.
* Then he rolled a 1, so basically same deal.
* Cal somehow managed to Back To The Future the Flux Capacitor! It started to fade from reality. Solomon broke the weapon anyway! The stuff inside melted over him, but it was evaporating as that happened. That didn’t seem to have been the plan.
* Solomon called the genie and asked for his final wish. The genie said “As you wish, Master” and it was creepy so Bec took matters into her own hands with a Magic Missile. This got her stabbinated by the spear-wielding yak guard.
* The genie unwound time in an attempt to retrieve the Flux Capacitor from before it was destroyed. Solomon immediately began to ripple and grow. There was an explosion and some of the party were knocked over and damaged.
* Solomon’s new monstrous form, reminiscent of Akira ([1](https://gifimage.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/akira-mutation-gif-1.gif), [2](https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1450974971ra/17493648.gif)), rolled over even his own defenders as he cried out in ecstasy, tears streaming down the face of his original head.
* Now free, the genie granted three boons to the party to aid them in fighting the abomination created by Solomon’s wish.
* After generating several “sane” heads and having them lopped off, the Solomon monster started generating “insane” heads.
* The SPI fought valiantly to destroy Solomon, finally succeeding: Solomon exploded in a shower of guts, blood and chaotic magic.
