1. SPI agents transport to Cognitutus using Callie's secret sigil sequence.
2. Freki saw a light far-off in the distance out to sea. He got the impression the light was very big, and therefore probably very far away.
3. They made their way through the vibrant underwater city to the Rockwell family manor. On the way, Callie insinuated that she was bringing these non-gnomes back to her family to serve as dinner. The driver seemed nonplussed. Oz discerned via innuendo that the driver had some criminal connections, but did not understand what they were trying to ask him.
4. The manor was strangely unoccupied, with no servants nor family to be found. The Cornucopia was sitting in a dominant position in the first-floor foyer, having completely crushed the teleportation circle there.
5. After exploring several lavish rooms, the agents happened upon the study, where a man named Reginald Auror sat at the desk, writing some notes. He recognized Callie and was unsurprised to see her.
6. The agents learned Auror was a security consultant hired to keep the Cornucopia safe from any and all threats. He had only just begun his assessment and plan to do this. He was initially gruff, but became slightly less rude as time went on. Auror claimed that Callie's parents were out at an important meeting, but did not know what it wasâ€”only that they would be back later that evening.
7. Auror mentioned "horrors from the deep" multiple times during their conversation. After Auror left the study, they inspected the document that he had been writing. It was a sketch of the area around the Cornucopia, with some jotted notes about protective spells. In one margin was drawn a cartoonish-looking fish monster.
8. Callie offered everyone snacks; the agents went to the kitchenette. There, they encountered Raliana, the long-time Rockwell family chef. She was happy to see Callie, and told her that her parents were out at a pre-arbitration meeting for Euphoria.
