The SPI valiantly battles the agents of [Pelor](../dossiers/pelor). The largest stone statue rumbles to life, and speaks with Pelor's voice! How dare they, mere mortals, interfere with a sacred artifact that protects an entire nation!

[Bram](../dossiers/bram) fires back! How dare he, a stupid god, take issue with his much more awesome goddess, [Melora](../dossiers/melora)! She knows what's best for the [Cornucopia](../relics/cornucopia)! And it sure as hell isn't safe where it is!

Pelor proposes a test of their valor and resolve: defeat his guardians, and he will allow the relocation of the Cornocupia. Two more stone statues rumble to life!

The SPI battles them, and is victorious! Pelor assents to their wishes. He also allows [Panthea](../dossiers/panthea) to drink from the Water of Life. She is judgedâ€”wracked with pain, and then falls dead. Her soul is cleansed, and in a better place now, Pelor says.
