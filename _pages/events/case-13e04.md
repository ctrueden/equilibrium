Cal has reclaimed the Arkenstab, and Talos is on the ropes! But Andalla has transformed into a goristro demon that is unlikely to serve you beer, and they both still have a boatload of hit points... Will Talos succeed in entering a berserker rage and laying waste to Alye'adu? Or will Bec enchant him again into an oblivion of giggles? FIND OUT NEXT TIME
