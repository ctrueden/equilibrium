> I stand amid the roar  
> Of a surf-tormented shore,  
> And I hold within my hand  
> Grains of the golden sand —  
> How few! yet how they creep  
> Through my fingers to the deep,  
> While I weep — while I weep!  
> O God! Can I not grasp  
> Them with a tighter clasp?  
> O God! can I not save  
> One from the pitiless wave?  
> Is all that we see or seem  
> But a dream within a dream?
