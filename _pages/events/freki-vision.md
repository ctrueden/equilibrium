Munin pecks Freki's eye. Freki has a vision:
* What was. Fire. Burning. Blood. Talos sneering disdainfully: "There is nothing else I need from a lycan" and he turns away.
* What is. Sabrina scoldingly to Andalla: "That bird was his friend!"; Andalla grinning wickedly with pointed orc teeth: "So? Spirit animals are delicious!" and she turns into a raven and flies.
* What might be. A ring on Talos's hand flashes, and his fist begins to glow. Effortlessly, he lifts Freki off the ground by his neck. "You are weak. Your people were weak. Afraid of who you really are, and the power within you. What a disappointment." He throws Freki down and swings the spiked chainâ€¦"
* WAKE UP! utters Munin, pecking Freki's eye again. It explodes in pain.

Munin tells Freki he is not yet ready. "It is not strength you lack, but wisdom. And allies."
