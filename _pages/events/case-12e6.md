STAY TUNED

callie, bec, freki realize mushrooms aren't real. just psychic residue.
sartus and bec dispel oz and cal's effects.
oz is convinced they were mentally real, and he has some psychic damage.
cal is just fatigued.

bec thinks the mushroom face woman is some legendary creature... not a fey creature... but she can't put her finger on it. neither can callie.

Tybalt sending to Cal:
We found the Book on the forest floor. Was this your doing? The Tree's getting
worse. The queen is deathly ill. What do you know?

Cal response:
Book not us. Tree has passages bored in. Queen infected by mushroom woman. Freki accidentally decapitated Queen in Feywild. Ritualing with Enoki now. Please advise.

--
Enoki group ritual with Callie, Bec, Vondal, Sartus. Sartus isn't helpful, but the others are. Enoki shoots out a massive number of spores from his cap and sends all the mushrooms away. "They won't act up again for a while. I need a nap..." and he collapses.

--
Tybalt sending to Cal:
Warforged searching area near Book. I will gather more intel and get back to you when I know more. More urgency now. Keep me apprised.

Cal response (right as the ritual completes): 
Group casting with Enoki. Will explore passages afterward. Will update with pertinent information. SO MANY SPORES! Mushroom problem resolved.

Why did Enoki find them where he did? Because that's where the mushroom trails led: to ground zero. He didn't bother explaining this, of course...

Create Sat Sep 3 @ 4p - 9p session for Equilibrium.

freki's birds -- see through their eyes? feel their feelings? speak to them telepathically?
- has done all of these...
- are they bird fish now?
