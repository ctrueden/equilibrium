1. The SPI traveled to Xaos, the City of Chaos, to look for the tribe of the Manufeai (gnoll tribe) because they heard something terrible and mysterious had happened to them.
2. After watching the hubbub for a while, they luckily encountered Bruck, who they persuaded to guide them to the site of the Manufeai, for a price. Bruck subsequently hired Vuthos as a co-guide.
3. At the site, the SPI met Ni, the sole surviving Manufeai gnoll, who hired them.
4. In Xaos, looking for a guide.
5. Bumped into Bruck, which was great because no one else would be a guide to the Manufeai.
6. Bruck reluctantly agreed, but said he needed to get supplies.
7. He came back with lots of supplies and another orc named Vuthos.
8. Tough trek through the jungle. Many huge spiders and other huge things. Vuthos enjoyed spearing and eating them. Bec and Callie studied the fauna, catching stuff in jars and drawing sketches. (Was Cal there? Was Vondal?)
9. Upon reaching the encampment, greeted by a shriveled orc witch doctor. "Good, you come," she said. She introduces herself as Ni, an elder of the tribe, and leads the party to the scene of the incident.
10. The zone is scorched with chaos, slain gnolls and parts thereof strewn around. One corpse has bees coming out of a honeycomb where its chest used to be. Another has a stone slab superimposed, jutting out of one buttock. The rest are similarly grotesque and unique.
11. Upon close inspection, all of their heads look... fiendish. Like demons. They wobble and begin breaking off at the neck. Vargouilles!
12. There is one corpse which is wearing especially nice armor and shield, with an angry eye sigil branded on it. It begins to change, muscles distending as it rises...
