The Age of Zas is a time long past, when [Aecus](../locales/aecus) was overseen by a benevolent deity called [Zas](../dossiers/zas). It is said that Zas, with the aid of many other eternals, [overthrew the tyranny of the Titans](titanomachy), ushering in a new era of peace and prosperity for mortalkind.

According to legend, at the beginning of this age, the [eternals](../creatures/eternals) reconstructed the world to have four seasons, so that people for the first time needed to seek the shelter of houses and had to labor to supply their food, rather than living idly in ignorance of suffering.

After death, people who lived during this age are said to have become "blessed [spirits](../creatures/spirits)" of the underworld.

*GM's note: this era is based on Hesiod's [Silver Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_age).*
