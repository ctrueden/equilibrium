### Location

Zombozo’s Traveling Circus, outside the big top, on the outskirts of Sanctum, capital city of the [Radiant Union of Pelor](../locales/rup).

### Patron

[Luminous Defenders](../orgs/luminous-defenders) hired them due to a legal obligation to the accused.

* Brother Alabastor, a mild mannered, friendly and bookish holy man.
* Zombozo is in custody, but swears he is innocent—he passed a [zone of truth](http://www.5esrd.com/spellcasting/all-spells/z/zone-of-truth/) test.
* The Luminous Defenders seem biased against Zombozo, because he is undead.

### Victims

Vanesse and Bernd Jaglia, young patrons of the arts.

* Wealthy husband and wife. First time at the circus, considering investing in the circus.
* Owlbears smelled the corpses. Weezer heard them snuffling.

### Crime scene

* Happened during the trapeze act and light show.
* Owlbears smelled the corpses. Weezer heard them snuffling and came over.
* Bodies found spiritually empty and with wide, bizarre smiles. There aren’t a lot of creatures that can cause that kind of damage.
* Bodies had lingering aura of necromancy.
* Some very large shoe prints (that could be clown shoes) were around the victims.
