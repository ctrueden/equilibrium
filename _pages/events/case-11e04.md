1. A sinister voice echoed in the room: “YOUR KINDRED IS IN OUR GRASP. BRING US THE PRIMARY CORPOREAL ELEMENT, OR WE WILL INCORPORATE THE KINDRED INTO OUR LEGION. WE ARRANGE A DISTRACTION—TO MINIMIZE INTERFERENCE FROM OTHER CORPOREAL BEINGS. BRING IT NOW. WE WILL GUIDE YOU. OR DO NOT, AND WE WILL WRACK YOUR TERRITORY WITH SUFFERING.”
2. Freki was backhandedly blessed by Pelor, and could breathe either water or air.
3. Rollo argued that the party should take the Cornucopia with them on a mission to locate the evil entities’ lair, destroy them, and save his wife Linistreya.
4. The group discussed how best to take the artifact out of the city and move on the lair of the big bad evil fish. They decided to speak to the city council, presenting themselves as agents of Linistreya, and request support.
5. Freki (reluctantly) opened his mind to Pelor, and felt a slight connection: “THE FUTURE IS YOURS TO SHAPE.”
6. Callie prayed to her deities for guidance: "Should we take the cornucopia, in whole or in part, out of Cognitutus; or should we leave it in the city where it is protected?" Her deities replied, “The fissures in your reality grow deeper... and time is a horizon beyond which even we gods see only imperfectly. Erathis: Take the Fountain, and all we have built may begin to topple and be destroyed. Avandra: Take the Fountain, and you may emerge triumphant over malevolent forces from before the dawn of time.”
7. The water smelled funny.
8. Oz scaled the Cornucopia and retrieved the horn, which became the Hornblade once he allowed the mysterious (and possibly malevolent) halfling spirit to touch him. The Hornblade functions as a +3 short sword of [sharpness](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/magic-items/magic-armor-and-weapons/#Sword_of_Sharpness) and [wounding](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/magic-items/magic-armor-and-weapons/#Sword_of_Wounding).
9. Gonna go talk to the Board of Regents! “Jeeves: to the Hall of Regents.”
10. Sirens started going off. Callie knew that this meant the fish army was already attacking.
11. Guards tried to keep the party out of the meeting, but they persuaded their way in by dropping Callie’s mom’s name.
12. Rollo attempted to speak to the Regents, but he is not a political creature and did not give a good speech.
13. Callie gave a speech: “We are aware of the threat to the city. My mother went on a mission to save it and she needs our help. I was granted a divine vision from Avandra. When you have an invasive plant, you do not just cut off the top and hope for the best. You dig it out root and stem! We are willing to lay down our lives for Cognitutus, what are you willing to do?”
14. Freki gave a speech: “I’m just a simple amphibious wolfman archer and I am willing to stand not only behind but in front of Callie to help.”
15. Oz gave a speech: “We are the SPI and this is what we do - we get results! The front line is not where you think it is.” He also stole a chicken drumstick as a prop/snack and wielded it to great effect.
16. After some deliberation, one of the regents (Kwalish) agreed to loan them her minisub called the Streamcutter, and one of the others (Aurora) agreed to come along on the crazy mission. The minisub also has a scout ship called the Crab that can be piloted by two gnome-sized people. The top can be put down like a convertible, although water will flood it unless a wizard can provide a diving bell sort of effect. There are 3 Caps of Water Breathing. It also has a button that will automatically teleport the sub back home, but it can only be used once. She also has an experimental module that might allow the sub to pass through a wall—or else scramble the sub and everyone on it.
17. Rollo went back to Rockwell manor to pick up some of his alchemical creations. He brought back 10 [oils of slipperiness](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/magic-items/potions-oils/#Oil_of_Slipperiness).
18. The party then met up with Aurora near the west gate, with guns on hand. It was clear the city’s alarms were going off in that area; curfew had been imposed. Attack seemed imminent.
