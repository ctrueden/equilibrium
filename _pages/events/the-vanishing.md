Fifty years ago, the war endedâ€”suddenly. All the soldiers fighting on the
warfront vanished without a trace, never to be seen again. After that, the
whole area became warped and twisted, resulting in what is now called the
[Flux](../locales/flux).

With no armies left to deploy, the war was effectively over.
