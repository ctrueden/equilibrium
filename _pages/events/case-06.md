### Victims

The [Manufeai](../orgs/manufeai), a tribe of [gnolls](../creatures/gnolls) reknowned for being vicious carnivores.

### Crime scene

The Manufeai appear to have been killed by some sort of Flux-related event: their bodies are twisted and some look like [demons](../creatures/demons) (Ni: “they grew stronger in death”).

When the SPI arrived, their leader, Rohna (female, gnoll, cleric of Yeenoghu), rose as some kind of demonic entity; other tribe members became [vargouilles](../creatures/vargouilles).

### Witness

There was a witness: [Freki](../dossiers/freki), a wildling ranger. He awoke during the conflict after apparently being unconscious for days(!?). He saw a goliath woman wielding a shimmering rainbow weapon approach the camp with malevolent purpose. She pointed the weapon at the camp guard (identified post mortem as Arrna by Ni) and overwhelming chaotic energy blasted forth, scorching the entire camp. Freki was knocked backward off his feet and fell unconscious.

### Tribes

Freki tells the SPI that several tribes frequent this area of the Jungle near [Xaos](../locales/xaos):

* The [Manufeai](../orgs/manufeai), a vicious [gnoll](../creatures/gnolls) tribe.
* The [Blood Hand Orcs](../orgs/blood-hand-orcs), a nasty band of [orcs](../creatures/orcs) who occasionally won’t kill you on sight.
* The [Malosi](../orgs/malosi), a tribe of outcasts too extreme for the other tribes, who value strength above all else, and have a fearsome reputation to match.
* The [Blackscales](../orgs/blackscales), a mysterious and xenophobic tribe of [lizardfolk](../creatures/lizardfolk).
* The [Stormherd](../orgs/stormherd), a tribe of [yikarians](../creatures/yikarians) (a.k.a. yak-folk) feared and hated by all others.
