1. Examined the crime scene, discovered secret vault door behind Tremere's portrait.
2. Opened the vault, and fought undead shadowspawn that burst out. Convinced Martine Andrews to join the fight, who demonstrated extraordinary combat abilities.
3. Talked to young Tremere, who claimed his murderer was Alyssa Morvain.
4. Learned of the missing book in the vault—the Necronomicon—which Tremere was studying in an attempt to cure his condition (also inflicted by that very book, which he found in Arallu 40 years ago). The only clue to the means of the book's disappearance was smudged chalk marks on the lectern which resembled a small teleportation circle.
5. Decided to travel to Euryale's villa the next morning. Vondal contacted Mallory to fill him in, but when the Necronomicon was mentioned, the boss ordered everyone back to HQ.
