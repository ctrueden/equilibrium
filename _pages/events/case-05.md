### Summary

An increasing flow of people were jumping from the Zenithal Summit of the Cliffs of Transcendence. Each longing for his wish to be granted. Each plummeting downward, never seen again…

The SPI was hired by Ou-sh- (pronounced Ow-&lt;whistle&gt;-sh-&lt;click&gt;), an [aarakocra](../creatures/aarakocra), and Grandmaster of Winds of the [Progression of Symmetry](../orgs/progression-of-symmetry), a monastic order practicing the Way of the Four Elements. Officially, Ou-sh- was supposed to be watching for [gargoyle](../creatures/gargoyles) threats from the Howling Gyre to the north—and was not supposed to interfere with internal city affairs. But off the record, she was very concerned that something sinister might be causing the rising tide of suicide jumpers from the Summit, near the Temple of Symmetry on the mountain top.

When Vondal found out that one of the jumpers was an orphan child, he went ballistic. In a rage, he fired wild magic at the Summit pedestal, which he could feel psychically calling out to him. There was an explosion, and a vortex opened in the sky. Vondal was sucked in; inside, he saw an endless pit filled with spiderwebs, demon spiders, and an enormous many-eyed spider deep within. He found Kára and Mishaal enwebbed, and freed them.

Meanwhile, one of the acolytes, a young red dragonborn named Ra’faj, ran from the temple to the summit, and activated a magic lamp of some sort. Black smoke swirled forth… Ra’faj was transformed into a white dragon, and he then attacked the agents in a rage. In self-defense, they slew him.
