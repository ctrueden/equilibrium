1. They left the scene with Freki and Ni, and made camp to decide what to do next. Ni decided to return to the scene after exchanging tokens in a binding agreement.
2. A lizardfolk ninja named Semu appeared, and—on strict orders from the elder of her tribe—gave the SPI a "voodoo compass" capable of tracking the five tribes of the area. Semu warned it must be returned after justice had been served. The compass was flat—the size of two hands together—with four needles, the tail of each attached to something grisly:

  * Manufeai: a fanged tooth
  * Blood Hand Orcs: a patch of skin
  * Malosi: a finger bone
  * Stormherd: a clump of fur

3. Semu said: "Our debt to the Concord is now paid. When you are finished with the compass, leave it in Xaos, at the shrine of Essyllis. Do not seek us out or you will die. The elder also bid I give you this." She handed them a bag of fire beads. "I warn you: her premonitions are incessant and melodramatic. Be measured in your response."
4. Two beads emitted prophetic words:

  * "Beware: the poltergeist seeks to fulfill its wish."
  * "The death of the wilds brings the world's ruin. Unless you act."

5. A third vibrated wildly, and when thrown in the fire, caused Vondal to materialize. And the fire snuffed out.
6. The party used the compass to find the Malosi. It led them to a tree with a magical portal entrance. Freki used his bird Hugen to scout, but it was noticed by an orc dragon shaman, who vaporized with magical energy of some kind. Freki attacked in retaliation, and the dragon shaman blasted him too with devastatingly powerful but partially uncontrolled auras. Callie managed to talk down the situation with a bluff, leading to an uneasy truce.
7. Andalla the shaman warned the party not to enter the portal (even though that's where the compass pointed), because inside was the Malosi chieftain Talos, who would likely kill them for trespassing.
8. Andalla told the SPI that Kavaki's favorite place was down by the river, so they went there, and encountered another member of the Malosi: an armored being with a very large two-handed sword, standing watch. Attempts to check it for magical auras revealed it was a "black hole" of magic. Vondal's wild magic backfired, creating an explosive fireball, which nearly killed Callie—but time slowed and a child emerged. She rubbed a substance over Callie's body and clothes, such that when the explosion resumed, Callie was not killed. "You should be more careful," the girl said. The party soon learned her name was Sabrina.
9. Sabrina was mischievous but friendly, and told them several important things:

  * She is friends with Kavaki.
  * Mengiris is her protector.
  * Talos uses Sabrina's powers for his own purposes, when she allows it.
  * She sculpts karach, which forms in underground caves where the Flux is strong.
  * She made a karach weapon for Kavaki, who was very insistent about needing it for reasons Sabrina does not know.

10. At the request of the SPI, Sabrina used her psychic ability to reach out to Kavaki. Bec created a [tiny hut](http://www.5esrd.com/spellcasting/all-spells/t/tiny-hut/), a magic bubble which would protect them from Sabrina's psychic disruption. Freki wanted no part of it, though, and was knocked unconscious by the mental force (think Professor X in the movie Logan). Mengiris was unaffected. Sabrina seemed substantially drained from the effort, saying she had done all she could. Shortly thereafter, Kavaki stumbled through the trees, having suffered grievous physical harm. "It's gone," she muttered, and then collapsed in exhaustion.
