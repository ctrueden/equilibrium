1. Vondal saw a vision of a stone of light, and a figure of light grasping it. Wild magic surge. Split into two Vondals.
2. Talked to and fought Zanic. Wild magic surge. Four Vondals. Zanic's claw was much more robust than expected, but after the hand was ripped to shreds by hounds and subsequently burned, he was quite dead.
3. Split up: briefed Mallory. He ordered further investigation into the magical aspects of the case (wanted necromancy trails fully explained, etc.).
4. While SPI team decided how to proceed next, Larsa Wrathborn showed up and discovered the body. Upset, she left to tell the Brandywhistle of Zanic's death.
5. SPI brought Zanic's body to the palace and talked to King Durak.
6. SPI returned to Gurin Aldrimor's keep. Confronted Bronce. He admitted that he covered up Hollerd's actions.
7. SPI made a deal with Bronce: Bronce and Hollerd pay for their crimes, SPI protects the secret of Esprit Repose for the good of the dwarven kingdom, in exchange for Rubinia Elka's full cooperation with the SPI in the future.
8. SPI went to Hollerd's farm. Met a female dwarf from Sima's village. Tybalt tried (and failed) to intimidate her; but Callie took a stab in the dark and used the dwarf's feelings for Hollerd to avoid combat. Confronted Hollerd and after a brief contest of wits, returned him to the authorities.
