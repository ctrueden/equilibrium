* [Ozborn](../dossiers/oz) wakes up; runs into [the Grandmaster of Earth](../dossiers/ceowyn-mandragoran) in the [SPI HQ](../locales/spi-hq). The monk tells him that it is a good thing Ozborn woke up, because he and [Callisto](../dossiers/cal) are needed by their friends now. "I see the tapestry of fate. If you do not join them, you will not be happy with how matters proceed." Ozborn wakes up Cal, they talk to [Mallory](../dossiers/mallory), and head out.
* Ozborn snags a [pixie](../creatures/pixies) after a slam-dunk hop and hands the pixie to [Freki](../dossiers/freki).
* We pepper the pixies with persistent petitions.
* Freki freaks and summons his [bi](../dossiers/hugin)r[ds](../dossiers/munin). The pixies scatter!
* [Vondal](../dossiers/vondal) wakes up in a trash heap. "Not again!" He is almost eaten by some kind of trash monster ([otyugh](../creatures/beasts#otyughs)). A [Kenku](../creatures/kenku) bird-man ([Weezer](../dossiers/weezer)) stops the trash monster from doing so.
* Also, Vondal is a pony now.
* [Ghensh](../dossiers/ghensh) goes to investigate. But then, the golem [Squatch](../dossiers/squatch) says his tummy hurts. Ozborn asks to look at it. The golem is agreeable. The part that hurts is weirdlyâ€¦ squishy. Ozborn and [Callie](../dossiers/callie) decide to do an "exploratory-investigatory surgery." Ozborn attempts to bribe the golem with a ball bearing, but the Kenku bird-man runs over and steals it.
* Vondal and the bird-man talk about shinies. He accuses the pixies of stealing his shiny disguise hat.
* Callie cuts open the golem and Bec notices that it has a fresh interior wound. Afterwards, [Meroe](../dossiers/meroe) and [Panthea](../dossiers/panthea) come over angry and Callie uses a heal wounds spell to mend the golem. Meroe is reluctantly thankful.
* The party interviews Panthea and Meroe again in some depth. They suss out that there was a past incident of [Zombozo](../dossiers/zombozo) getting "out of control," which Panthea is emotional about somehow...
* [other things that have been forgotten in the mists of time]
* The party presses Meroe increasingly harder. She becomes agitated, and decided to pull the trigger on her trap: a wired underground infrastructure of bombs. The ground from her desk explodes outward and collapses, exposing the underground lair of the [landsharks](../creatures/beasts#bulettes) Fair and Foul.
