* Fire was all over, and several people fell into the pit down the rockslide of rubble.
* Vondal tried to use wild magic to mitigate the situation, but managed to turn himself and Ozborn into potted plants.
* Meroe tried to kill everyone with magic. She used obscuring mist and then confusion on the owlbears Fuzzy and Wuzzy.
* Vondal the plant sparkled, and over the next moments, exploded into a giant beanstalk.
* Meroe implored Panthea to “remember her promise,” which Panthea reluctantly did. She apologized and pushed Ghensh off of his carpet.
* But then, the party persuasioned Panthea into surrendering after Meroe was critically injured. Panthea agreed to surrender in exchange for fair treatment.
* But the landsharks were still attacking, doing devastating damage. As such, everyone rallied and climbed the beanstalk up into a mystical sparkling realm, leaving all their problems behind forever!
