* Vondal and Bec both create bubbles of stable reality. Because they both are powerful, the realities combine.
* Panthea’s body starts morphing.
* Vondal decides to reshape reality in the form of a playground. Panthea tries to grab at the playground equipment with her hair, but she is too clumsy and can’t grab it. Everybody flails around in various ways. Vondal wills a yachtopus (half octopus, half yacht) into existence so everyone can ride together.
* Panthea turns into an anemone. Ghensh imposes his will on reality and turns everything into pure platinum. Various things get stuck in the platinum and eventually tumble together and start cruising down the mystical flow atop the yachtopus.
* Freki intuited that there were two ways out of this place: a “high risk, high reward” direction toward crisis but also salvation; and a “low risk, low reward” direction away from harm, but away from destiny.
* The party encounters a strange scene: the body of Alex Orbach, with his heart cut out in the same manner as Dominick Tremere’s was—and a twisted small-sized creature wearing Priscilla Stormcloud’s clothes eating of it.
* The creature sees them. Bec sleeps the creature, and they take it with them on the yachtopus, along with Orbach’s body.
* Freki traces the flow of this place to its center, and they see SPI HQ.
* The creature awakens and transforms into a huge demon!
