1. Bec attempts to feel out telepathically, but everything is mentally...obfuscated.
2. The party has many opportunities to avoid Aboleth Doomsday! But for some reason, it seems they’d like to touch everything in here. It’s not a great idea.
3. There’s this magical orb that seems to be kind of a lightning rod for magic. Crazy messages from the psionic monster:

  1. Callie – "begone your vileness(knowledge-cleverness-goodness-hope), it has no place here(void), vanish(sleep-die) for a while until your body(essence-soul) can be replaced with another more worthy(empty-cruel-infinite), this is always your choice(transformation-or-destruction)"
  2. Bec – "we have destroyed(stab-of-pain-soul-ripped-out-of-body) much more powerful wizards(stab-of-hate) than you could ever become... on your own... their knowledge belongs to us... and you, if you join us"
  3. Freki – "bit by bit... your curse consumes you(pain-of-jaws-rending-into-your-right-hand/claw, rich-delicious-blood-in-your-mouth)... turn your hunger to the ones more deserving(hatred-divine-magical-energy-radiating-from-the-organs-of-beings,organs-that-have-only-ever-been-there-for-you-to-eat) and grow strong(be-your-own-god,worship-at-your-own-feet,rip-away-your-body-and-eat-it,it-holds-you-back)
  4. Oz – “you are the death(weapon-to-cleave-all-weapons,all-things) we have craved, raw impetuous undiscipline aligned with the void(our-unrealm-the-space-before-space-and-time-before-time), embrace your true existence(joy-at-breaking-rules,taking-what-you-want,no-authority-blunting-your-whim), total freedom forever.

4. Bec sees some creatures peering in through the walls. Then they start coming through the walls, arrrggggghhhhhh.
5. All our attacks bounce right off the orb. :(
6. Oz impulsively attacks the weird observing creatures. Two of the creatures grapple him while another one starts pulling pieces off its body and hucking them at Oz.
7. Bec, the smart person, decides to attack the pillars instead. This seems to work well! But since she is the only smart person, everyone else keeps attacking the fish-food zombies. :(
8. Oz’s attacks cause the creatures to fall apart into 8 tiny piranhas. :O
9. Using the Trident of Fish Command, Callie realizes that all the creatures attacking are part of one, giant, fish, creature. And somewhere in the legion of things that make up this thing, is Callie’s mom!!!!
10. ~~Aboleths eat the party and obtain the Cornucopia and Lamp.~~ NO THEY DO NOT...Maybe?
11. The meaning of time and space in the campaign world is corrupted.
