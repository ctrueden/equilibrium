[ANNA] A creature formed from a swarm of locusts called Issham (sp?) appears and offers to take us where we're going. He says our means of travel will take too long. 

[ANNA] Inochi the mushroom lord HATES the locust guy because locusts eat his mushroom pals. He flat refuses to go with Issham.

[ANNA] The party comes up with a convoluted plan to travel via getting into a portable hole. Unfortunately, Freki's discomfort with magic causes him to panic when he gets in the hole and go into wolf form.

The SPI agents decline [Eixam](../dossiers/eixam)'s help. They buzz off.

[Enoki](../dossiers/enoki) offers to carry them in the portable hole instead, now that he knows they have one.

[Bec](../dossiers/bec) casts rope trick inside the portable hole, so they have 1 hour of air.

[Freki](../dossiers/freki), [Vondal](../dossiers/vondal), Murky are also in the hole-inside-a-hole.

Freki wolfs out and tries to escape the hole. Vondal casts *banishment* on him to boot him from the extradimensional space. [Callie](../dossiers/callie) calms emotions.

Callie levitates using her tattoo, towed by Freki, who is now flying from [Sartus](../dossiers/sartus-morningdew)'s spell. Sartus also flying.

Monkey grows huge divine wings after having trouble carrying Oz and Cal for 20 minutes. Oz has vision of a woman in a dark cloak, face down, turning... on the other side, a red-haired woman in a green and yellow dress:

Ten minutes later, sending from Tybalt to Cal: "Found druid's lair. Yaara'tal Yggdrasil cave near elderly tree-melded. Sima dead, chained inside. Other Sima captured. Infected Queen awakening, spells doom. Hurry!"

Cal's response: "Holy crap. Enoki leading us to Fruit. 30 minutes away. Eixam, locust thing, hovering nearby. Friend or foe? Two Simas?"

Tybalt: "Heard of a creature of vermin, evil being. Be wary. Glad but surprised Enoki helps. Yes two Simas, one must be imposter. Will find out."
Cal: "Will update as soon as something changes."

[ANNA] Eventually, we come to a place where there is a thick mist. Something called a hamadryad (https://www.5esrd.com/database/creature/hamadryad/) by the name of Phoebe emerges from the mist. Inochi recognizes her and says, "Your Grace? What are you doing here?" Cal recognizes her too! She seems to recognize him, but he seems a little suspicious of her. He asks her directly if she knows Hyperion. I recall that Hyperion is the name of a titan.

[ANNA] Issham seems to hate the hamadryad! He tells her she shouldn't be here. Bec asks immediately why. He lies, "because it is not safe."

[ANNA] Phoebe takes us through the tree into a very, very beautiful place. There is the fruit that we've been looking for! It's way too big to put in the portable hole or otherwise transport. Bec and Sartus warn the party that there is a powerful illusion magic happening. Issham agrees, "Yes, this is wrong."

[ANNA] Phoebe starts walking toward the fruit, transfixed.

[ANNA] Sartus says, "Your Grace, it is not real." But she keeps walking.

[ANNA] Vondal casts Wall of Fire between Phoebe and the fruit.

[ANNA] The fire burns away the mist and the glamour with it. The mist flows into Vondal's mouth. Beyond the glamour, the tree ends. If Phoebe had kept walking, she would have fallen off it. She snaps out of her trance.

[ANNA] Confused, she says, "But I brought us to the fruit. We are here, at the heart of it."

[ANNA] Bec asks Issham whether that's true. He answers, "perhaps."

[ANNA] Inochi scouts and then reports, "There, I see it! That way!"

[ANNA] The party follows where he's pointing. It looks like a dead end. It looks like he's flying through the trunk. Another illusion?

[ANNA] Freki goes through it and sees the true heart in the distance, surrounded by a huge amount of thorns. He hears Inochi cry out in fear. (The rest of the party is still on the other side of whatever border this is, so they don't hear it.)

Marching order when tree striding with the hamadryad:
* Right hand: Cal, Sartus (Enoki&Moth on Sartus's shoe), Oz (Dr. Z in live form on his shoulder), Vondal (Murky in spider form on his head) -> Eixam
* Left hand: Freki, Bec, Callie, Vondal (Murky in spider form on his head) -> Eixam

They get there.. but something is not right! The Fruit is an illusion!

Beyond the illusion's bounds: Enoki is trapped in a huge thicket of thorns, which are supernaturally surging toward the party!
