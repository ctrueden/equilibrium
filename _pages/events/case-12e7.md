They decline Eixam's help. They buzz off.

Enoki offers to carry them in the portable hole instead, now that he knows they have one.

Bec casts rope trick inside the portable hole, so they have 1 hour of air.

Freki, Vondal, Murky are also in the hole-inside-a-hole.

Freki wolfs out and tries to escape the hole. Vondal banishes him. Callie calms emotions.

Callie levitating, towed by Freki, who is now flying from Sartus's spell. Sartus also flying.

Monkey grows huge divine wings after having trouble carrying Oz and Cal for 20 minutes. *SPOILERS* Oz has vision of Dallah Thaun, face down, turning, Yondalla on the other side. But doesn't know their names of course.

Ten minutes later, sending from Tybalt to Cal: "Found druid's lair. Yaara'tal Yggdrasil cave near elderly tree-melded. Sima dead, chained inside. Other Sima captured. Infected Queen awakening, spells doom. Hurry!"

Cal's response: "Holy crap. Enoki leading us to Fruit. 30 minutes away. Eixam, locust thing, hovering nearby. Friend or foe? Two Simas?"

Tybalt: "Heard of a creature of vermin, evil being. Be wary. Glad but surprised Enoki helps. Yes two Simas, one must be imposter. Will find out."
Cal: "Will update as soon as something changes."

Marching order when tree striding with the hamadryad:
* Right hand: Cal, Sartus (Enoki&Moth on Sartus's shoe), Oz (Dr. Z in live form on his shoulder), Vondal (Murky in spider form on his head) -> Eixam
* Left hand: Freki, Bec, Callie, Vondal (Murky in spider form on his head) -> Eixam

They get there.. but something is not right! The Fruit is an illusion!

Beyond the illusion's bounds: Enoki is trapped in a huge thicket of thorns, which are supernaturally surging toward the party!
