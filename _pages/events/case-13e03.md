The [SPI](../orgs/spi), after tearing the veil protecting the hidden [changeling](../creatures/changelings) village of [Alye'adu](../locales/alyeadu), learned that the SPI's leader [Mallory](../dossiers/mallory) has been comatose here for the past four months. Now [Andalla](../dossiers/andalla) the orc shaman, in the form of [Freki](../dossiers/freki)'s raven companion [Munin](../dossiers/munin), and [Talos](../dossiers/talos) the centaur warlord, wielding the [Arkenstab](../relics/arkenstone), have followed the agents through, and seek to seize the power of the changelings for themselves!
