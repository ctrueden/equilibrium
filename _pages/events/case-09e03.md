* Cassandra heals Freki.
* Vondal realizes there is virulent wild magic sparkles afoot.
* Mallory comes, Mallory leaves to get backup.
* Cassandra says she knows that the agents have a part of some power, and the creature has some part, and this power craves to become whole again.

### Callieâ€™s Diary

* I joined hands with my fellow magicians and cast Dispel Magic once.
* Then we decided to use the Arkenstone in Cal's sword as a focus, to cast Dispel Magic harder.
* After that, all my magic got sucked into the sword!
* And then Meroe and Panthea ran away.
* I was so mad, I pulled out my crossbow and shot at them!
* After Ozborn stabbed her, I saved Meroe's life with Vondal's wand of healing.
* Then we all went out to the designated teleportation circles to check for new recruits.![|165x117](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/elw3UZQddMJ3EtfTvRtmZrzkWRgFuiOXk-qQxXmeXaSP85ORChURULZexGtChJH-KwOJIeyj9wRpzJBElZFve5YLT7zYz3uhYv9_c6x6LIJhmFZCOF0W3CmxDFYSlySpcVUQmOEKdRHWCvzfuyRSrC_y5XJhLkSCdptHMod7_pKxSnzo6kfsKVlm)
* We found one! She came back and sparred with Freki. Her name is Mary Reed.
* Mary almost killed Freki! I used the wand of healing again.
* Then I was tired, so I went to bed. We are supposed to be wild-magic-quarantined anyway. What could go wrong?
