* [Cassandra](../dossiers/cassandra) heals [Freki](../dossiers/freki).
* [Vondal](../dossiers/vondal) realizes there is virulent wild magic sparkles afoot.
* [Mallory](../dossiers/mallory) comes, Mallory leaves to get backup.
* Cassandra says she knows that the agents have a part of some power, and the creature has some part, and this power craves to become whole again.

### Callie's Diary

* I joined hands with my fellow magicians and cast Dispel Magic once.
* Then we decided to use the [Arkenstone](../relics/arkenstone) in [Cal](../dossiers/cal)'s sword as a focus, to cast Dispel Magic harder.
* After that, all my magic got sucked into the sword!
* And then [Meroe](../dossiers/meroe) and [Panthea](../dossiers/panthea) ran away.
* I was so mad, I pulled out my crossbow and shot at them!
* After [Ozborn](../dossiers/oz) stabbed her, I saved Meroe's life with Vondal's wand of healing.
* Then we all went out to the designated teleportation circles to check for new recruits.
* We found one! She came back and sparred with Freki. Her name is [Mary Reed](../dossiers/mary-reed).
* Mary almost killed Freki! I used the wand of healing again.
* Then I was tired, so I went to bed. We are supposed to be wild-magic-quarantined anyway. What could go wrong?
