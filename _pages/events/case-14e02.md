## Callie's Journal

[Freki](../dossiers/freki) offers a mutually beneficial alliance. In response, the woman holds out her hand and says we can kiss her ring if we want to serve. [Bec](../dossiers/bec) and [Callie](../dossiers/callie) notice that the ring is the symbol of [Vecna](../dossiers/vecna), who deals in secrets.

Bec realizes that this woman is [Lady Ilyana Nightshade](../dossiers/ilyana-nightshade). She says, "What I need is worship. What you need is knowledge and power, and I can offer both."

Freki is not about to agree to any of her terms. She snaps her fingers and figures start appearing out of nowhere, flanking her on both sides. They look like angels with broken-off wings, staring at her adoringly.

But the last one is [Vondal](../dossiers/vondal)! This lady is as surprised as the rest of us to see him.

The lady orders Bec to be silent and she is *silence*d for one round!

Freki pulls out his bow because this is pretty hostile. He feels an attempt to take over his mind and says, "That is gonna cost you an arrow." He shoots her with *ensnaring strike* and then says, "Can we stop?"

[Oz](../dossiers/oz) tries to stab her. She doesn't dodge, but also he doesn't seem to do any damage to her&mdash;his sword deflects around some invisible barrier she has. Then he saunters around behind Freki and taunts her from there.

[Cal](../dossiers/cal) knows that Lady Nightshade is supposed to be undead, though this person standing in front of us doesn't seem to be. He decides to wait and see what happens.

Lady Nightshade tries to force everyone to obey her. It works on Oz, who suddenly sees how totally reasonable and awesome she is. Why doesn't anybody else get it??

Vondal casts *mage armor*. He senses that this place is chaotically infused with Flux. There are tendrils everywhere! There is a wild magic surge, but Vondal feels that now that he knows about the place, he might be able to avoid it next time. There's a lot of positive energy in this place, so much that we're all healing slowly every round. So the result is that a unicorn appears and nuzzles Vondal.

Callie pets the unicorn. It touches its horn to her hand and she is suffused with holy power!

Freki readies an arrow.

Lady Nightshade offers Oz a potion and he makes to take it, but Callie slaps his hand in reaction.

Bec realizes Oz is acting strange and casts *dispel magic* on him. Freki tries to stop him from taking the potion, but Oz dodges! However, the charm is dispelled by the time he gets to the potion, so he tries to grab it and smash her in the face with it. He's been in a lot of bar fights, y'all! The glass...turns out to be a lot thicker than he thought and he has to make 4 Wisdom saving throws, lol.

The angels, or whatever they are, all turn to him and say in unison, "DrInK iT." They charm the everloving shit out of him!

The unicorn is furious at Oz's attempt to hit its mistress, so it tries to gore him with its horn. Oz trips and falls down, but keeps his grip on the potion bottle. 

Hold onto your butts, it's Vondal's turn. He decides to cast *charm person* on Oz. The air gets all weird and shimmery around him and he is shunted to the Astral Plane. So why is he still here? Also, the Charm succeeds so now Oz is charmed by Vondal.

Callie can't even reach out to Oz before the unicorn knocks Oz to the ground. Callie tries again to grab the bottle out of his hands and barely manages to yoink it. She makes it disappear with sleight of hand, but unfortunately, the only person who saw where the bottle went was Oz. Womp womp.

Freki furiously roars, "Stop!" but it comes out kind of...badly rolled.

Lady Nightshade orders Callie to drink the potion. With a lot of help from Vondal, she is barely able to resist. She gets a little taste and it tastes delicious! But she still resists.
