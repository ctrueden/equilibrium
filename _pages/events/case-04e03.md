* Agents race through the garbage tunnels beneath the resort&mdash;the walls of which have entrapped thousands of people in expressions of shock, dismay, and agony&mdash;before they can be eaten by gibbering mouthers.
* [Sima](../dossiers/sima) mysteriously has a vision of a specific path to follow, which leads to an elder brain in a pool deep within.
* [Vondal](../dossiers/vondal) dubs the brain "Brian" in sympathy for its desire to unite the whole world in [Flux](../locales/flux).
* Sima embeds both of her axes into the brain, dashing its hopes of becoming one with all of [Aecus](../locales/aecus).
* The walls entrapping all the resort visitors release the people...? Memory of the following few days are lost to flux poisoning.
