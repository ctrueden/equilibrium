The SPI was on the trail of a [suspected doppelganger](../dossiers/amisa-swiftaxe), the spitting image of one of their [former colleagues](../dossiers/sima). But then her trail suddenly disappeared midstep! And [Freki](../dossiers/freki) is being shadowed by a mysterious and malicious-seeming third raven...

---------

Freki asks [Hugen](../dossiers/hugen) and [Munin](../dossiers/munin) if they saw where they prey went. They tell Freki:

{% include quote text="
She vanished -- one moment there, the next, gone.
She walked through the veil.
We cannot follow without knowing what she knows.
" %}

Oz's hand feels weird as he waves his sword through the space where the step ends.

TODO finish these notes!
