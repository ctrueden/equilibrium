1. Examined the crime scene.
2. Interviewed [Dominic Tremere](../dossiers/dominic-tremere) at his manor; got a list of names from him (see above).
3. Visited the Beastly Colosseum and interviewed [Rowena Darkshield](../dossiers/rowena-darkshield), its proprietor.
4. [Callie](../dossiers/callie) fed the list of names to [Gavin](../dossiers/gavin-pepperpotts), her assistant; he recognized only two of them.
5. [Tibalt](../dossiers/tybalt) canvassed the area around Sartan's apartment. He spoke to a young boy who claims to have witnessed a hooded figure being let in to Sartan's apartment on the night of the murder.
6. [Callisto](../dossiers/cal) and [Sima](../dossiers/sima) spoke to the monster trainers, [Argus Saravor](../dossiers/argus-saravor) and [Bellamy Crue](../dossiers/bellamy-crue), about their whereabouts on the night of the murder, and related topics.
7. The SPI agents watched the monster arena battles that evening: [Gorgon](../creatures/beasts#gorgons) vs. [Basilisk](../creatures/beasts#basilisks), the Ultimate Showdown of Stone! The gorgon won.
8. Later that night, while the agents were booking their rooms at an inn, they were magically contacted by [Martine Andrews](../relics/warforged), the synthetic butler: "SPI. Come quickly. He is dead."
