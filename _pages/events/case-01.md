Some weeks after SPI HQ burns to the ground, and all field agents have gone missing, four new recruits apply to join the SPI on the same day.

* **[Calumnystra (Callie) Rockwell](../dossiers/callie)**, a well-off [gnome](../creatures/gnomes) who is "not the muscle," specializes in ancient and mystical objects, and is "sometimes clairvoyant."
* **[Tibalt Nightbreeze](../dossiers/tybalt)**, a one-eyed half-[elf](../creatures/elves) with a demonstrated magical knack.
* **[Callisto](../dossiers/cal)**, a stout [halfling](../creatures/halflings) outlander with "nowhere else to go" who seems uncomfortable in the city.
* **[Sima Cordelia](../dossiers/sima)**, a [dwarven](../creatures/dwarves) ranger with an affinity for animals, who "is the muscle" and believes her gifts should be shared with the world.

The head of the [SPI](../orgs/spi), **[Mallory](../dossiers/mallory)** ([dwarf](../creatures/dwarves), male), seems to accept them with hardly an interview, and assigns them to a case straight away, urging them to learn to work together as a team.

A human woman named **[Cassandra](../dossiers/cassandra)**, who seems to be Mallory's administrative assistant, gives each recruit a sparse initiation packet, as well as a briefing on the first case. Included in the packets is the sigil sequence to the mysterious new (and windowless) SPI HQ.

### Victim

**[Sartan Winterfrost](../dossiers/sartan-winterfrost)** (half-elf, male)
* Found petrified, with pieces raggedly broken off and missing (eaten??)
* Trusted accountant of Dominic Tremere

### Crime scene

* Very small apartment on the poor side of town; missing basic amenities
* Ledger of expenses and income from the Tremere household
  * Lists recent sales of antiquities; one to **[Gavin Pepperpotts](../dossiers/gavin-pepperpotts)**, Callie's executive
  * Two pages (from 3 and 8 weeks ago) torn out
  * Upon close examination, the numbers don't add up—Sartan was skimming
* Locked chest containing IOUs and losing gambling tickets from the Beastly Coliseum
* Sartan was obviously petrified, but how?
  * **Cockatrice** has a petrifying bite, but it wears off after 24 hours.
    * A cockatrice is not strong enough to destroy one of its stone victims. It usually just flees afterwards.
  * **Gorgon** has petrifying breath, which is permanent.
    * But Sartan's death is not consistent with a Gorgon's M.O.: single opponent, and he wasn't gored first, nor ground into powder afterward.
  * **Basilisk** has a petrifying gaze, which is permanent.
    * Damage is consistent with a Basilisk's M.O.: breaking apart and eating the stone piece by piece.
  * **Medusa** has a petrifying gaze, which is permanent.
    * They don't typically destroy the statues they create.
    * They are much rarer than the other monsters.
  * The powerful *flesh to stone* spell can petrify a victim.
    * But damage to the apartment is consistent with a monster attack.

### Persons of interest

**[Donovan Morvain](../dossiers/donovan-morvain)** (red half-[dragon](../creatures/dragons)? [dragonborn](../creatures/dragonborn), male)
* Local law enforcement, an officer of the Luminous Defenders—but maybe not a paladin?
* Condescending and unhelpful

**[Morvain's unknown partner](../dossiers/sennik-cromwell)** ([human](../creatures/humans), male)
* Another officer of the L.D., bearing a symbol—a heart impaled on a dagger—for an apparently less common paladin order
* Described as friendlier than Morvain—but less friendly than the ubiquitous paladins of the Devotion order

**[Dominic Tremere](../dossiers/dominic-tremere)** ([human](../creatures/humans), male)
* Rich old man, and employer of the victim; he is the one who called in the SPI
* Runs an aggressive business selling antiquities
* Lives in an ostentatious manor in a rich, hilly part of town
* Paranoid that someone wants him dead—gives the SPI his list of prime suspects
  * **Lady Eden the Dispassionate**
  * **Lord René Wendel** – a nobleman with a penchant for buying art
  * **Lord Galen Ahmed**
  * **Mihael Carpus the Senior**
  * **[Pulchritudinous Euryale](../dossiers/pulchritudinous-euryale)** – a noblewoman art dealer
  * **Susilo Albin**
  * **Walter Vahid**
* Has fired several prior accountants, but was pleased with Sartan; apparently unaware that Sartan was cooking the books

**[R. Martine Andrews](../relics/warforged)** (robot?, "female")
* Butler of Dominic Tremere
* Appears sentient, but without emotion

**[Rowena Darkshield](../dossiers/rowena-darkshield)** ([dwarf](../creatures/dwarves), female)
* Arenamaster of the Beastly Coliseum
* Had motive: Sartan owed her money
* Claims she has "other ways" to deal with problems, and ensure people pay debts: the Coliseum has a business arrangement with Xaryu's Perfect Order (see below)

**[Argus Saravor](../dossiers/argus-saravor)** (green [dragonborn](../creatures/dragonborn), male) and **Panoptes**, his basilisk
* Driven basilisk trainer who still lives with his mother
* According to Bellamy Crue, has a thing for Rowena Darkshield
* No alibi: took Panoptes for a walk outside the Coliseum three nights ago

**[Bellamy Crue](../dossiers/bellamy-crue)** ([human](../creatures/humans), female) and **Brutalis**, her gorgon
* Inquisitive and observant gorgon trainer with a tough attitude
* Alibi: She was at a party three nights ago, and Brutalis was in his pen during the fights

**[Xaryu of the Perfect Order](../dossiers/xaryu)** (beholder)
* Domineering and xenophobic head of the Xaryu Syndicate—or "Perfect Order" as they call themselves
* Authorities believe its lair to be somewhere beneath city streets—but have not pinpointed which city, since the Syndicate has a presence within several of them
