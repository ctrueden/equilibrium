* Vondal leaves the Amulet of Vecna's Lore in the safe in his house, along with his retirement savings. Then everyone met back up in the tunnel near the entrance to the old HQ.
* Lightning breath and shenanigans ensue. The old HQ has been consumed by the Flux. The gang escapes while Ghensh serenades the guard (Lomagret Drakehead) and proceeds to get drunk with her.
* Meroe has a resurgence of flux taint. Vondal sees that Panthea also is still affected by the taint but has yet to tell the rest of the party.
* Seirye wants to secure the Cornucopia by teleporting it away using a group ritual. The SPI agents do not necessarily agree, but Meroe is willing to do anything to get healed.
* The team heads to Oasis to prepare for the journey. Vondal plans to catch up in an hour.
