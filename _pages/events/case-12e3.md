With [Sartus Morningdew](../dossiers/sartus-morningdew), the agents start climbing the [World Tree](../relics/yggdrasil), staying together. They climb up a 60-foot area. They find the Tree's immature “golden path” of trees above. Then they find a blighted zone. Inside one of the dead trees are some beetles roving in a circle; in another, a sleeping sprite, which [Ozborn](../dossiers/oz) wakes up. The sprite sleepily climbs out of the tree, spies the agents, and screams an ear-splitting shriek!
