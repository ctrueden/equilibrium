1. The party slew the demonic reanimations of the tribe.
2. They spoke to Freki, who had witnessed the actual crime a few days before.
3. Flux Capacitor! Named by Stephanie!
4. Cal was itchy from the vargouille.
5. Callie paid Freki 5 gold to help find some plants to cure the itching.
6. Callie and Bec used the sending stone to Mallory:
  * **Callie:** Flux-based weapon in hands of Malosi goliath. Client wants revenge, also weapon. Cal itchy. Poisoned?? Abandoned by guides 4 days from city.
  * **Mallory:** Malosi exceptionally formidable. Gather more intel. Make a solid plan. Definitely capture that weapon. Why itchy? Plant? Poison? Spell? Cure him ASAP. Hire new guide.
7. Ni and Freki exchanged tokens: he gave her a special arrow, and she gave him one of her jingly bells. She said he is now bound to help, and he said she is bound to use the weapon for good. She promised to only slay those who deserve it.
8. Ni left, saying she will await news from them regarding the incident. She seemed to believe that some of her tribe may have lived (in a sense) through this ordeal, and made stronger.
9. Freki gathered more herbs and various plant stuff, to restock arrows, and get Itchy some more cold cream.
10. Callie tried to heal Cal again. She cast Cure Wounds and flushed the taint out of Cal's body.
11. Freki called out to Hugen to fly cover. He sensed contact and acquiescence.
12. The party discussed how to find the Malosi, since that seemed to be their best lead.
13. Bec tried to form an alliance with the taciturn Freki. The SPI wanted to hire him as a guide. Freki said he could do as well as the people that they had. He wanted 11 gold a day, payable upon first access to a teleportation circle.
14. The party did a round of introductions.
