* The agents, including Cassandra and Audreth, proceed upstream.
* Five shadowy undead flux monsters attack them!
* One turns into shadow Oz, another into shadow Cal; both are destroyed.
* Two more flee downstream after being turned by Callie.
* The last one turns into a shadow copy of the monkey and flees upstream.
