* The agents, including Cassandra and Audreth, proceed upstream.
* Five shadowy undead flux monsters attack them!
* One turns into shadow Oz, another into shadow Cal; both are destroyed.
* Two more flee downstream after being turned by Callie.
* The last one turns into a shadow copy of the monkey and flees upstream.

## Madness

As madness begins to grip the agents, [Vondal](../dossiers/vondal) strains to influence the flows of the [Flux](../locales/flux) to minimize the nightmarish impact.

* (50 hours) ~~Cal suffers from partial amnesia. He knows who he is and retains racial traits and class features, but doesnâ€™t recognize other people or remember anything that happened before the madness took effect.~~ &rarr; [Cal](../dossiers/cal) loses the ability to speak.

* (2 minutes) [Oz](../dossiers/oz) experiences vivid hallucinations and has disadvantage on ability checks.

* (permanent) ~~Bec can't take anything seriously. The more serious the situation, the funnier she finds it.~~ &rarr; [Bec](../dossiers/bec) has discovered that she really likes killing people.

* (60 hours) ~~Freki regards the Flux with intense revulsion, as if affected by the antipathy effect of the [antipathy/sympathy](https://2014.5e.tools/spells.html#antipathy%2fsympathy_phb) spell.~~ &rarr; [Freki](../dossiers/freki) is under the powerful delusion that he can squeeze himself in anywhere, as though under the effect of a [freedom of movement](https://2014.5e.tools/spells.html#freedom%20of%20movement_phb) spell.

* (7 minutes) [Callie](../dossiers/callie) does whatever anyone tells her to do that isn't obviously self-destructive.

* (permanent) ~~Vondal feels compelled to repeat a specific activity over and over, such as washing hands, touching things, praying, or counting coins.~~ &rarr; Vondal regards the [Great Old One](../dossiers/great-old-one) with intense revulsion, as if affected by the antipathy effect of the [antipathy/sympathy](https://2014.5e.tools/spells.html#antipathy%2fsympathy_phb) spell.

* (7 minutes) ~~Whenever Audreth takes damage, he must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throws or be affected as though he failed a saving throw against the [confusion](https://2014.5e.tools/spells.html#confusion_phb) spell. The confusion effect lasts for 1 minute.~~ &rarr; [Audreth](../dossiers/audreth) is unconscious.

* (50 hours) [Cassandra](../dossiers/cassandra) is blinded.
