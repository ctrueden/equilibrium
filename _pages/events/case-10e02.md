On the first night of camp, we discuss the prospects of stealing the cornucopia, as Seirye wants us to do. Freki asks about what will happen to the region if we take the artifact away. Bec asks why take it, rather than one of the smaller relics?

Seirye says:

1. The lamp is in SPI custody (Vondal took it to hide)
2. The Necronomicon was stolen and a Druid called Isis Rakesh has it
3. The Warforged went after the Necronomicon
4. The stone is also in SPI custody (Cal has it)
5. The ship is at sail in the Infinite Ocean, exact whereabouts unknown
6. The tree is even bigger than the cornucopia
7. The puzzlebox was stolen by Alex Orbach, who claimed to have it in his possession, although nobody got a look at it.

Freki interrogates Seirye rather rudely and she storms out. Callie tries to talk her down and gives her a little information about the puzzlebox. Seirye is unhappy that people don’t believe her.

On the second night, Meroe is doing worse. Her affliction resembles mummy rot (but isn’t), also resembles turning into undead (but isn’t that either).

On night four, Meroe throws up dead bees.

On the fifth night, Meroe can hardly go any farther. Freki decides to leave and see if he can retrieve the water. Meroe confesses to the circus crime. She framed Zombozo for the murder because he killed her parents when she was 13 (also he sucked as a manager, but mainly the parents thing). Also, after Freki leaves, Panthea rips out a chunk of her hair and it turns into Oz. Seirye beats the hair with her quarterstaff as it turns into our party member.

Then, a worm! Right after supper the worm attacks and is strangely attracted to Meroe but the party (with Freki hurriedly returning from his scouting ahead) manages to kill it before it can harm anyone.

On day six, Seirye tries to convince us to go through with the heist. When we won’t agree, activates her bracelet of friends, and summons her pirate boss, Bram the Blithe! We learn that Seirye is really Anne “Bonny” Qin, Seirye’s sister, and notorious first mate of the dreadnought Tempest. The time travel schtick was a ruse. But Anne and Bram insist that the goddess Melora really did tell them that a great calamity is coming, and the artifacts need to be secured. In any case, we agree to continue to the Cornucopia in order to heal Meroe and Panthea.

On day seven, Meroe is comatose, so we pull her in a makeshift sled.

We arrive at the Cornucopia. There are two Luminous Defender paladins there, two weeks off schedule! Meroe has awoken, and is acting strange, claiming she is fine. She meanders toward the paladins. As she reaches the Cornucopia to take a drink, one of the paladin tries to put his hand on her shoulder: “Halt! Who are you? What are you doing?” His hand passes through her body like sand, and she falls forward, dissolving into dust.
