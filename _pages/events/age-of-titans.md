The Age of Titans was a legendary golden age, when [Aecus](../locales/aecus) was young and still half-formed, and the [Titans](../creatures/titans) ruled the cosmos.

[Creatures of all kinds](../creatures) were said to freely mingle, with peace and harmony prevailing. [The earth](../dossiers/gaia) provided food in abundance, and people lived to very old age but with a youthful appearance and eventually died peacefully. The [spirits](../creatures/spirits) of these ancient people are said to live on as beneficent guardians of mortalkind.

*GM's note: this era is based on Hesiod's [Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age).*
