1. Returned to HQ to speak to Mallory. Discussed the cases and the book. Got some supplies for dealing with petrification.
2. With Martine Andrews, traveled to Euryale’s villa outside of Haven. From the looks of her villa (underground in some dwarven ruins), they concluded she was very likely a medusa, and probably the culprit.
3. Spoke to her about petrification under a ruse of Callie’s grandmother being afflicted, but made her a little suspicious of their intentions.
4. Left the villa. After discussion, decided to apprehend her before she could escape.
5. She resisted; they fought. Martine Andrews aided the SPI agents during the fight.
6. Brought the defeated Euryale back to base, and interrogated her. Learned that she had traded the book for a potion which would make her human again. Made a deal: Euryale would reveal all she knew about the two cases, in exchange for being allowed to use the potion to restore her humanity.
7. Euryale told the SPI the name of the book’s recipient: Isis Ra’ksh, an ex-druid who worships disease, probably a terrorist. “She is the worst person in the world to possess that book—and it was worth it.”
8. Talked to the Contessa, who handed over the necklace, and confessed her role in Tremere’s death, as well as the secret that Euryale was using to blackmail her: her son Donovan is half fiend. She agreed to be an informant for the SPI, in exchange for their discretion.
9. Returned to Tremere’s manor. Spoke to Andrews without Tremere present: told her that Isis Ra’ksh now had the Necronomicon. Then gave the necklace back to Tremere, and told him the good news: Euryale was apprehended. “This is cause for celebration! Andrews, bring the wine. Our best vintage!” But she was gone.
