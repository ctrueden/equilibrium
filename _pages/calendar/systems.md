</figure>

Before the Flux, every nation had its own languages, and own way of tracking time.
When the Aecus Concord was founded, a common language was established, and a
common calendar was founded which honored all the major religions.

The sun and moon move in tandem, somehow linked. But while the sun rises around
different elemental poles over the course of the year, creating seasons that
differ by region, the phase of the moon looks the same to everyone worldwide.
And so the new moon was chosen as the hallmark of a new lunar year.

## Months of the year

A year in Aecus consists of 368 days: 12 months of 30 days each, plus 8
dedicated days for each of the elemental apexes (i.e. summer solstices), when
the sun sits highest in the sky centered at one of eight aligned elemental
orientations.

| 12 | Idea     | [Erathis](../dossiers/erathis)   | Knowledge, War   | As secrets are revealed, can Aecans build a better world together? |

## Days of the week

The Aecus common calendar uses five-day weeks, with six weeks per month:

* Skyday is always on the 1st, 6th, 11th, 16th, 21st, and 26th of the month.
* Forgeday is always on the 2nd, 7th, 12th, 17th, 22nd, and 27th of the month.
* Woodsday is always on the 3rd, 8th, 13th, 18th, 23rd, and 28th of the month.
* Kinsday is always on the 4th, 9th, 14th, 19th, 24th, and 29th of the month.
* Evensday is always on the 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, 25th, and 30th of the month.
* Apexday is used to refer to the days of the eight elemental apexes.

## The solar and lunar cycle

A curious feature of Aecus's solar/lunar annual cycle is that the sun does not
move at a constant speed around the elemental poles, but rather spends more
time each year near the Arenan quadrant. Some scholars believe this is due to
[Pelor](../dossiers/pelor)'s affinity for the elements of Air and Fire. As a
consequence, some nations have an imbalance of seasons, as noted in the
following table.

Furthermore, the moon does not move through its phases evenly throughout the
year, but rather spends substantially more time waxing than waning, reaching
its fullest at the midpoint between the Arenan and Ignan solar apexes, and
its newest at the midpoint between the Terran and Glacian solar apexes.

for a full breakdown of the Aecus Concord calendar, and how it
aligns with the various regional calendars discussed below.

## Regional calendars

Even with a common calendar system, many regions also use their own calendars
colloquially. The following calendars are still in use in certain regions.

### Aquan

The Aquan year is divided into 13 months of 28 days each,
with an additional festival day for each of the four seasons.

| ## | Month     | Season           | Symbol      | Notes                           |

GM's note: the Aquan calendar was adapted from the
[Eberron calendar](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Calendar).

### Ignan

Before the Flux, the Radiant Union of Pelor and the dwarves of the Mountain
shared a calendar aligned to their weather.

The Ignan year is split into 12 months of 28 days each, and four eight-day
festivals, each placed at three-month intervals. The months and festivals are
commonly referred to as the Dozenmonth of Luna and the Four Festivals. 

| Month | Common     | Elven       | Nomads   | Season      |
|:-----:|------------|-------------|----------|-------------|

|   12  | Sunsebb    | Lacysnows   | Wolf     | Winter      |

The first of the month is always a Starday, and the rest follow as shown below:

* Starday is always on the 1st, 8th, 15th, and 22nd of the month.
* Sunday is always on the 2nd, 9th, 16th, and 23rd of the month.
* Moonday is always on the 3rd, 10th, 17th, and 24th of the month.

* Waterday is always on the 5th, 12th, 19th, and 26th of the month.
* Earthday is always on the 6th, 13th, 20th, and 27th of the month.
* Freeday is always on the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th of the month.

The festivals use the same day names as regular months for the first 7 days,
with the 8th and final day of each festival known as Festday, as well as
given a season-specific name: Winterday, Greenday, Moonpeak, and Feastday
for Needfest, Growfest, Richfest, and Brewfest respectively.

GM's note: the Ignan calendar was adapted from the
[Greyhawk calendar](https://calendars.fandom.com/wiki/Greyhawk_Calendar).

## Elyria

Like the Aecan calendar, the fey calendar is divided into 12 months of 30 days
each, plus 8 special days. But unlike others, the elves celebrate moderation
rather than extremes. As such, rather than marking when solstices occur, they
celebrate seasonal midpoints, illustrative of their philosophy of balance.

Years are counted since the last planting of the World Tree, with each
planting referred to as a Cycle&mdash;e.g. Year 985, Cycle 37.

Months are divided into 10-day segments known as tendays, with no names per
day. For example, 21 Hammer is the 1st day of the 3rd tenday of Hammer.

### The Selva

Selvan tribes count time in sixteen groups of 23 days each.
There are no special festival days, nor breakdown into week days;
every day is a good day to be alive.

### Trell

On the islands of Trell, the year is sorted into 12 months of varying length:
29 to 31 days, depending on the month. There are also two special days
highlighting the days before the winter and summer solstices respectively.

The months are named according to infernal ideals, with each month having
an associated Asmodeal lesson known as a *slogan*, which are taught to
Trell children to foster self-improvement and success as they develop.
