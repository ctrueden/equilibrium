Golems are not truly living creatures, but rather constructs of magic.

They have been successfully built from a variety of materials:
[iron](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#iron%20golem_mm),
[clay](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#clay%20golem_mm),
[stone](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#stone%20golem_mm),
and even [flesh](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#flesh%20golem_mm).

There are even whispers of a legendary golem made from liquid mithral.
