The dragonborn are a [bipedal](../glossary#bipedal) race whose form resembles that of a dragon, having a scaled hide and a dragonlike head. They are proud and brave, with strong ties to clan, tradition, and family. They commonly reside in the cities of the [Zephyr Federation](../locales/zephyr-federation).

Like their [dragon](dragons) kin, there are many kinds of dragonborn, typically differentiated by color.
