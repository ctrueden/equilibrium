The kenku are a [bipedal](../glossary#bipedal) bird race reminiscent of magpies.
They can mimic the sound of anything they hear. A kenku asking for money might
make the sound of coins clinking together, and a kenku referring to a busy
marketplace can reproduce the cacophony of hawking vendors, barking dogs,
bleating sheep, and the cries of street urchins. When mimicking voices, they
can only repeat words and phrases they have heard, not create new sentences. To
converse with a kenku is to witness a performance of imitated sounds and almost
nonsensical verse.
