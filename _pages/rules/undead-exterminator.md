*GM's note: This rogue archetype is adapted from [Monster Slayer](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/ranger:monster-slayer) (p43 XGtE) and [Scout](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/rogue:scout) (p47 XGtE).*

| Level | Class Features |
|------:|:---------------|
|     3 | **Undead Sense:** Gain the ability to peer at an undead creature and discern how best to hurt it. As an action, choose one undead creature you can see within 60ft of you. You immediately learn whether the creature has any damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities and what they are. If the creature is hidden from divination magic, you sense none.<br>**Exterminator's Prey:** You can focus your ire on one foe, increasing the harm you inflict on it. As a bonus action, you designate one undead creature you can see within 60ft. The first time each turn that you hit this target with a weapon, it takes an additional 1d10 damage from the weapon. This benefit lasts until you finish a rest. It ends early if you designate a different undead creature. |
|     9 | **Supernatural Defense:** You gain resilience against your prey's assaults on your mind and body. Whenever the target of your Exterminator's Prey forces you to make a saving throw and whenever you make an ability check to escape that target's grapple, add 1d10 to your roll.
|    13 | **Ambush Master.** You excel at leading ambushes and acting first in a fight. You have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, the first undead creature you hit during the round of combat becomes easier for you and others to strike; attack rolls against that target have advantage rolls until the start of your next turn. |
|    17 | **Sudden Strike.** You gain the ability to counterattack when your prey tries to sabotage you. If the target of your Exterminator's Prey forces you to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against the quarry. You make this attack immediately before making the saving throw. If your attack with advantage hits, your save automatically succeeds, in addition to the attack's normal effects. |
