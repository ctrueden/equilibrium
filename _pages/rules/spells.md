## Analyze Portal (Age of Freedom)

*3rd level divination*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Components:** V, S, M (a crystal lens and a small mirror)  
**Range:** 60 ft  
**Area:** Cone-shaped emanation from you to the extreme of the range  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 round per level  
**Saving Throw:** See text  
**Spell Resistance:** No

*Seeing with a magic eye, you sense the portal. Studying it, knowledge about the portal comes into your mind as though it was a memory you could not recall until now.*

You can tell whether an area contains a magical portal or the effect of a gate spell. If you study an area for 1 round, you know the sizes and locations of any such portals in the area. Once you find a portal, you can study it. (If you find more than one portal, you can study only one at a time.)

Each round you study a portal, you can discover one property of the portal, in this order.

* Any key or command word needed to activate the portal.
* Any special circumstances governing the portal's use (such as specific times when it can be activated).
* Whether the portal is one-way or two-way.
* A glimpse of the area where the portal leads. You can look at the area where the portal leads for 1 round; the range of your vision is the spell's range. *Analyze portal* does not allow other divination spells or spell-like abilities to extend through the portal. For example, you cannot also use **detect magic** or **detect evil** to study the area where the portal leads while viewing the area with **analyze portal**.

For each property, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 17. If fail, you can try again in the next round.

*Analyze portal* has only a limited ability to reveal unusual properties, as follows.

* Random Portals: The spell reveals only that the portal is random and whether it can be activated now. It does not reveal when the portal starts or stops functioning.
* Variable Portals: The spell reveals only that the portal is variable. If you study the portal's destination, the spell reveals only the destination to which the portal is currently set.
* Creature-Only Portals: The spell reveals this property. If you study the portal's destination, the spell reveals where the portal sends creatures. If it is the kind of portal that sends creatures to one place and their equipment to another place, the spell does not reveal where the equipment goes.
* Malfunctioning Portals: The spell reveals only that the portal is malfunctioning, not what sort of malfunction the portal produces.

## Copy (Age of Zas)

*1st level evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** Special  
**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of blank parchment, or a book with blank pages, and a drop of black ink)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Copy enables you to make a perfect copy of a map, letter, or any other written or drawn document. You must have a blank parchment or a book with blank pages of sufficient size to hold the copy. You hold the blank object over the object to be copied, then cast the spell; the copy immediately appears on the formerly blank object. The copy is permanent and is a perfect duplicate of the original.

Copy can also be used to copy a 1st level spell from a new spell book into the your spell book, assuming your spell book is of sufficient size to contain the new spells, and you possess the necessary magical inks of sufficient value (typically 50 gp per spell level; see [Copying a Spell into the Book](https://www.5esrd.com/database/class/wizard/#TOC-Your-Spellbook)). The copied spell is instantly transcribed into your spell book using the magical inks, adapted to your personal spellcasting notation.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can copy a spell whose level is the same level as the spell slot used.For example, casting at 4th level allows you to copy a 4th level spell into your spellbook.

## Deeppockets (Age of Zas)

*2nd level enchantment/transmutation*

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** 1 garment  
**Components:** V, S, M (tiny golden needle and a strip of fine cloth)  
**Duration:** 12 hrs. + 1 hr. per level

This spell enables you to specially prepare a garment so as to hold far more than it normally could. A finely sewn gown or robe of high quality material (at least 50 gp value) is fashioned so as to contain numerous hand-sized pockets. One dozen is the minimum number.

The deeppockets spell then enables these pockets to hold a total of 100 pounds (five cubic feet in volume) as if it were only 10 pounds of weight. Furthermore, there are no discernible bulges where the special pockets are. At the time of casting, you can instead chose to have 10 pockets each holding 10 pounds (1/2 cubic foot volume each).

If the robe or like garment is sewn with 100 or more pockets (200 gp minimum cost), 100 pockets can be created to contain one pound of weight and 1/6 cubic foot volume each. Each special pocket is actually an extradimensional holding space.

If the spell duration expires while there is material within the enchanted pockets, or if a successful *dispel magic* is cast upon the enchanted garment, all the material suddenly appears around the wearer and immediately falls to the ground. You can also cause all the pockets to empty with a single command.

## Distract Assailant (Age of Freedom)

*1st level enchantment*

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Components:** V, S, M (the dried wing of a fly)  
**Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 1 round  
**Saving Throw:** Wisdom negates  
**Spell Resistance:** Yes

*Buzzing under your breath like a fly, you swat at the sky and toss the fly's wing in your hand into the air. The target of your spell becomes distracted, starting at shadows and looking about for unseen assailants.*

A creature affected by this spell can't take reactions and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws until the beginning of its next turn.

## Glass Strike (Age of Freedom)

*7th level transmutation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Components:** V, S, F (a piece of glass from a mirror)  
**Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 levels)  
**Target:** One creature or 4 cubic ft. of material  
**Duration:** 1 hour per level  
**Saving Throw:** Constitution negates  
**Spell Resistance:** Yes

*The spell erupts from the surface of the mirror you hold, striking your foe square in the chest and transforming it to glass.*

You transform the target into glass. You can cast either of these two versions:

* Glass Creature: As [flesh to stone](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/3e_SRD:Flesh_to_Stone), but the subject becomes glass.

* Glass Object: An object of up to 4 cubic feet in volume is affected. Part of a larger object (such as a floor or wall) can be transformed by this spell. Glass has hardness 1, and 1 hit point per inch of thickness.

Neither version of the spell affects magic items (magic items carried by a transformed creature remain intact). When the duration ends, the subject returns to its original materials. If the subject was broken or damaged while in glass form, its normal form has similar damage.

## Greater Malison (Age of Zas)

*4th level enchantment*

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Area:** 30-foot-radius sphere  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** 2 rounds per level  
**Saving Throw:** None

This spell allows you to adversely affect all the saving throws of your enemies. Opponents under the influence of this spell make all saving throws at a penalty of -2.

## Haste (Age of Freedom)

*6th level transmutation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Components:** V, S, M  
**Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 levels)  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 1 round per level  
**Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates (harmless)  
**Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

The transmuted creature moves and acts more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several effects.

* On its turn, the subject may do one of the following things as a bonus action:
  * Move up to their movement speed.
  * Make a single attack (melee, ranged, or unarmed).
  * Cast a spell with a normal casting time of 1 action.
  * Activate a magic item that normally requires an action to activate.
  * Use a special ability that normally requires an action to use.
* The subject gains a +4 haste bonus to AC. The subject loses this bonus whenever it would lose a dodge bonus.
* The subject can jump one and a half times as far as normal. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus.

*Haste* dispels and counters *slow*.

## Monk's Fighting Grace (Age of Freedom)

*2nd level transmutation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Personal  
**Target:** You  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 minute per level

You become a skilled unarmed fighter, gaining the ability to fight as a monk. You gain a mystic insight into the training necessary to fight with your fists and feet, allowing you to make phenomenal attacks that overwhelm your enemies.

You gain the Improved Unarmed Strike feat and a +2 competence bonus to hit with your unarmed attacks. These attacks deal 1d6 points of normal damage. You gain an insight bonus to your AC equal to your Wisdom bonus. In addition, you may use the monk class's flurry of blows ability to make an additional attack in each round. You gain these abilities so long as you do not wear armour. Even the lightest protection, such as padded or leather armour, is too bulky and restrictive to allow you to fight with your new martial arts skills.

While under the influence of this spell, you may use unarmed attacks to deliver touch spells such as *chill touch*. Make an attack as normal. On a hit, you deal your improved unarmed damage in addition to the touch spell's damage. If your attack misses your opponent's normal AC but hits his touch one, you deal damage only with your touch spell.

## Replicate Casting (Age of Freedom)

*9th level transmutation*

**Components:** V, S  
**Casting Time:** 1 round; see text  
**Range:** See text  
**Effect:** One spell or spell-like ability  
**Duration:** See text  
**Saving Throw:** See text  
**Spell Resistance:** See text

*The enemy mage raises her hands, and a cone of swirling, multicolored winds appears at her fingertips. Then she laughs and says, "Can you do that?" You smile and reply, "I can now."*

You duplicate the effect of any one spell or spell-like ability you have seen within the last round. This spell can duplicate only spells and spell-like abilities of 8th level or lower. This duplication functions like the ability of a *wish* spell to duplicate another spell, except that it is not limited by type of spell (divine or arcane) or by what school the effect is from. If the casting time of the spell you observed is greater than 1 round, the casting time of this spell is increased to the same.

A duplicated spell or spell-like ability functions as if you had the appropriate spell prepared and were casting it yourself. If the spell or ability has an XP cost, you must pay that XP cost. If the spell has a costly material component, you must provide that component or pay an additional XP cost equal to the gold piece value of that component divided by 5.

## Suggestion (Age of Freedom)

*3rd level enchantment*

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 levels)  
**Target:** One living creature  
**Components:** V, M  
**Duration:** 1 hour per level or until completed  
**Saving Throw:** Wisdom negates  
**Spell Resistance:** Yes

The character influences the actions of the enchanted creature by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable.

The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what he was asked to do. The character can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell expires, the activity is not performed.

A very reasonable suggestion causes the save to be made with a penalty (such as 1, 2, etc.) at the discretion of the GM.

## Tenacious Dispelling (Age of Freedom)

*3rd level abjuration*

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Components:** V, S  
**Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. per level)  
**Target or Area:** One creature or object, or 20-ft.-radius burst  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
**Saving Throw:** None  
**Spell Resistance:** No

*A wave of your hand sweeps away some of the magical effects on your target, but a surge of energy within you wants another try.*

This spell functions as a targeted *[dispel magic](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/3e_SRD:Dispel_Magic)*.

If you cast *tenacious dispelling* again before the end of your enxt turn, the second casting can function either as a targeted or area *dispel magic*, and you gain a +2 bonus on dispel checks made as part of the spell.

## Wall of Greater Dispel Magic (Age of Freedom)

*8th level abjuration*

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Components:** V, S, DF  
**Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 levels)  
**Effect:** A straight wall whose area is up to one 10-ft. square per level  
**Duration:** 1 minute per level  
**Saving Throw:** None  
**Spell Resistance:** No

*You cast the spell and a translucent wall springs up, a shimmering field of faded colors that swirls and merges with itself like the surface of a soap bubble, pulsing with strong, malignant shades than spin and twist into each other.*

This spell creates a transparent, permeable barrier. Anyone passing through it becomes the target of a [greater dispel magic](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Greater_Dispel_Magic) effect at your caster level. A summoned creature targeted in this way can be dispelled by the effect. A *wall of greater dispel magic* cannot be seen or felt by ordinary means, or even with a *see invisibility* spell. *Detect magic* indicates the presence of the effect, and *true seeing* reveals its presence.

## War Mastery (Age of Freedom)

The target must meet all prerequisites for this feat, including minimum ability scores, base attack bonus, or other feats. The target of this spell chooses the feat he wishes to gain when he receives this spell. If the feat works only with a single weapon, the target chooses the weapon. If the recipient selects a feat for which he does not meet the necessary requirements, he does not gain a feat and the spell is lost.
