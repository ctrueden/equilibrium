## Copy (Silver Age)

*1st level evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** Special  
**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of blank parchment, or a book with blank pages, and a drop of black ink)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Copy enables you to make a perfect copy of a map, letter, or any other written or drawn document. You must have a blank parchment or a book with blank pages of sufficient size to hold the copy. You hold the blank object over the object to be copied, then cast the spell; the copy immediately appears on the formerly blank object. The copy is permanent and is a perfect duplicate of the original.

Copy can also be used to copy a 1st level spell from a new spell book into the your spell book, assuming your spell book is of sufficient size to contain the new spells, and you possess the necessary magical inks of sufficient value (typically 50 gp per spell level; see [Copying a Spell into the Book](https://www.5esrd.com/database/class/wizard/#TOC-Your-Spellbook)). The copied spell is instantly transcribed into your spell book using the magical inks, adapted to your personal spellcasting notation.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can copy a spell whose level is the same level as the spell slot used.For example, casting at 4th level allows you to copy a 4th level spell into your spellbook.

## Deeppockets (Silver Age)

*2nd level enchantment/transmutation*

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes
**Range:** Touch
**Target:** 1 garment
**Components:** V, S, M (tiny golden needle and a strip of fine cloth)
**Duration:** 12 hrs. + 1 hr./level

This spell enables you to specially prepare a garment so as to hold far more than it normally could. A finely sewn gown or robe of high quality material (at least 50 gp value) is fashioned so as to contain numerous hand-sized pockets. One dozen is the minimum number.

The deeppockets spell then enables these pockets to hold a total of 100 pounds (five cubic feet in volume) as if it were only 10 pounds of weight. Furthermore, there are no discernible bulges where the special pockets are. At the time of casting, you can instead chose to have 10 pockets each holding 10 pounds (1/2 cubic foot volume each).

If the robe or like garment is sewn with 100 or more pockets (200 gp minimum cost), 100 pockets can be created to contain one pound of weight and 1/6 cubic foot volume each. Each special pocket is actually an extradimensional holding space.

If the spell duration expires while there is material within the enchanted pockets, or if a successful *dispel magic* is cast upon the enchanted garment, all the material suddenly appears around the wearer and immediately falls to the ground. You can also cause all the pockets to empty with a single command.

## Greater Malison (Silver Age)

*4th level enchantment*

**Range:** 60 feet
**Area:** 30-foot-radius sphere
**Components:** V
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Duration:** 2 rounds/level
**Saving Throw:** None

This spell allows you to adversely affect all the saving throws of your enemies. Opponents under the influence of this spell make all saving throws at a penalty of -2.

Alternatively, you may select any one school of magic and cause your enemies to make all saving throws against magic from that school at -3.

## Suggestion (Bronze Age)

*3rd level enchantment*

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**Target:** One living creature  
**Components:** V, M  
**Duration:** 1 hour/level or until completed  
**Saving Throw:** Wisdom negates  
**Spell Resistance:** Yes

The character influences the actions of the enchanted creature by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable.

The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what he was asked to do. The character can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell expires, the activity is not performed.

A very reasonable suggestion causes the save to be made with a penalty (such as 1, 2, etc.) at the discretion of the GM.
