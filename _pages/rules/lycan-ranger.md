## Beast Form

*This ability replaces the standard ranger's Favored Enemy.*

You have an animal within, which manifests under certain conditions such as during a full moon, in times of high emotional stress, physical trauma, or other triggers.
* The GM may call for a Wisdom saving throw (DC based on circumstances) to resist transforming.
* While in beast form, the following rules apply:
  * +4 Strength, +4 Constitution, -2 Dexterity, -2 Intelligence, -4 Wisdom.
  * Due to the Constitution increase, extra HP equal to 2 × character level.
  * +20 speed.
  * Advantage of Wisdom (perception) checks based on hearing or smell.
  * Vulnerability to silver? And maybe other things...?
  * Claw: TODO
  * Bite: If you successfully hit a target one size larger than you or smaller, you can use a bonus action to attempt to grapple. Make an opposed Strength (athletics) check. If successful, the creature is [grappled](http://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Grappled) by you. It has disadvantage on attack rolls, Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws. Allies attacking the grappled creature have advantage on the attack roll.
  * Multiattack. When you take the Attack action you can attack multiple times. You can make two attacks with your claws and one with your bite.

TODO Distinct rules for hybrid vs full beast form.

### Scent of Blood

At 6th level, after damaging an enemy in beast form, you smell their blood, sending you into a frenzy. Your attacks versus that target do an additional +1d6 damage.

TODO does the frenzy have any downsides?

## TODO 14th level beast form ability

## Special Arrows

*Together with Innate Natural Abilities, this ability replaces the standard ranger's Spellcasting.*

* At 2nd level, you learn to create unique types of arrows, made from natural flora and fauna of the jungle or other region(s). He knows how to craft a number of arrow types as follows: L2:2, L3-4:3, L5-6:4, L7-8:5, etc.
  1. Work with the GM to create each arrow type. As a rule of thumb, choose either: A) a ranger spell that makes sense as an arrow, of a level a standard ranger could normally cast; or B) an arrow type listed in the [arcane archer arcane shot options](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter:arcane-archer).
* There is no limit to the number of arrows you may prepare or use, but crafting the arrows takes time and resources. You may spend a day harvesting materials and crafting arrows. You make a Survival roll:
  1. DC 15 to harvest materials for one arrow of a random type
  2. DC 25 to focus on harvesting materials for a specific type of arrow
  3. For every 5 exceeding the DC, you harvest materials for another arrow.
* The arrows last awhile, but not forever: eventually the plant matter decays. Arrows more than ~1 month old have a chance of diminished effect. The GM rolls this chance secretly when the arrow is used.

## Innate Natural Abilities

*Together with Special Arrows, this ability replaces the standard ranger's Spellcasting.*

* The ranger has a number of abilities equal to the number of ranger “spells known”
* The player should work with the GM to create abilities. Each ability needs some animalistic tie or justification to fit the theme. As a rule of thumb, choose a ranger spell that makes sense as an innate ability. The ability may need adjustment to fit as an innate ability rather than a spell.

## Beast Companion

*This ability replaces the standard ranger's 3rd level archetype ability. See also the Ranger’s Companion ability of the Beast Master ranger archetype.*

At 3rd level, you become bonded to mystic spirit animals of unknown origin. They are loyal, but not beholden, to you.

TODO flesh out these rules more

## Primeval Awareness

*This ability replaces the standard ranger's Primeval Awareness.*

Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestiais, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn't reveal the creatures’ exact location or number, but does suggest an approximate strength of presence, which is affected by the creatures’ quantity, force of will and distance. Use of this ability is regained with a long rest.

## Focused Shot

*This ability replaces the standard ranger's 7th level archetype ability.*

* Starting at 7th level, you can focus your concentration when attacking at range. As an action while no enemy threatens you in melee, you make one ranged attack with advantage on the roll.

## L11 TBD

*This ability replaces the standard ranger's 11th level archetype ability.*

Michael & Curtis TODO - more mental control over beast form -- reduced stat penalties?

## L15 TBD

*This ability replaces the standard ranger's 15th level archetype ability.*

Michael & Curtis TODO

## Legendary Hunter

*This ability replaces the standard ranger's Foe Slayer.*

At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your marked enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied. While in beast form, you may activate this ability versus any enemy (though still only once per turn).

TODO - hunter's mark is an innate natural ability that Freki chose, but is not part of this class in general. Address this discrepancy.
