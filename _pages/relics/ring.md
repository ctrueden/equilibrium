An apocryphal divine relic that [Timor Invictus](../dossiers/timor-invictus) theorized to have once existed upon seeing the central ring symbol of the [Celestial Hand](celestial-hand), encircled by symbols of the eight divine [relics](.).

While in the [Brucolac](../dossiers/cronus)'s [Elysian Sanctum](../locales/elysian-sanctum), an ancient ruined church, [Vondal](../dossiers/vondal) saw a vision of himself as someone else, wearing a ring. Although the vision is murky, Vondal knows that she and three others, elves, are channeling their power into a ritual to amplify the ring's power, so that it can wash over the world and heal everyone's madness. But as the ritual reaches its apex, the ring cracks and explodes&mdash;one of the participants has betrayed her and spoiled the ritual at the critical moment! Instead of healing the world, its fabric has been torn asunder, and the [Flux](../locales/flux) begins leaking through the wound.
