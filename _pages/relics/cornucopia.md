title: Cornucopia
---

A huge multitiered fountain topped by a horn of plenty, from which holy water springs. It is believed to be one of eight divine [relics](.) somehow central to the integrity of reality itself. It is said that worthy drinkers receive [Pelor](../dossiers/pelor)'s blessing, while the unworthy are judged.

The Cornucopia was in the desert in the Radiant Union, seven days journey on foot from Oasis, but it was [stolen](../events/case-10) by agents of the SPI at the suggestion of [Bonny Qin](../dossiers/bonny-qin) and [Bram the Blithe](../dossiers/bram-the-blithe). After proving themselves worthy by overcoming Pelor's challenge, the agents and their allies used a magical ritual to transport the entire structure to [Callie](../dossiers/callie)'s childhood home, Rockwell Manor.

On a later visit home, Callie and her fellow agents discovered that an ancient evil, the [aboleths](../creatures/aboleths), had infiltrated Rockwell Manor, corrupted the minds of its residence, replaced one of the staff, and even abducted [Callie's mother](../dossiers/linistreya-rockwell) in an effort to acquire the Cornucopia's legendary power. During the SPI's battle with the aboleth, a [ghostly figure](../dossiers/dallah-thaun) enticed [Ozborn](../dossiers/oz) into claiming the Cornucopia's horn, transforming it into the Hornblade.
