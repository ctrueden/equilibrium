A lamp of illusions made real, believed to be one of eight divine [relics](.) somehow central to the integrity of reality itself.

It somehow made its way into the possession of [Ra'faj](../dossiers/rafaj), a dragonborn acolyte of the [Progression of Symmetry](../orgs/progression-of-symmetry). According to Ra'faj's diary, he was using it to manipulate people into jumping from the Zenithal Summit for reasons he did not fully articulate, although the SPI believes he was a member of some sort of secret cult.

The Lamp is now in the SPI's possession. Preliminary research suggests that the Lamp grants wishes tainted by the wielder's heart.
