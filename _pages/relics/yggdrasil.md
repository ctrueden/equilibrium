An enormous tree at the base of which lies the elven city of [Estanesse](../locales/estanesse). It is believed to be one of eight divine [relics](.) somehow central to the integrity of reality itself.

The [elves](../creatures/elves) believe it sustains all life and guard it vigilantly from outside influence.

Miles high, the Tree is far too big to move, but legend has it that it can bear fruit, and that its branches and leaves have power as well.
