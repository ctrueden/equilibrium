Once the infamous Hand of [Vecna](../dossiers/vecna), it became the Celestial Hand when the [SPI](../orgs/spi) purged the evil influence from the [Necronomicon](../relics/necronomicon) and returned [Timor Invictus](../dossiers/timor-invictus)'s bound soul back to his body, which triggered an explosion of positive energy that inverted Invictus's unlife and everything bound to him, including the Hand.

Now, [Bec Galere](../dossiers/bec) has taken possession of the Hand, after receiving secret information from [Vecna](../dossiers/vecna) in exchange for a vital secret about [karach](../relics/karach). But it seems like Vecna did not know the Hand had undergone this transformation.

After attuning with the Hand, Bec has been in telepathic contact with three voices within the Hand: Hecate, Circe, and Medea. Their true natures are yet unknown...
