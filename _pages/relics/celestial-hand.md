Once the infamous Hand of [Vecna](../dossiers/vecna), it became the Celestial Hand when the [SPI](../orgs/spi) purged the evil influence from the [Necronomicon](../relics/necronomicon) and returned [Timor Invictus](../dossiers/timor-invictus)'s bound soul back to his body, which triggered an explosion of positive energy that inverted Invictus's unlife and everything bound to him, including the Hand.

Now, [Bec Galere](../dossiers/bec) has taken possession of the Hand, after receiving secret information from [Vecna](../dossiers/vecna) in exchange for a vital secret about [karach](../relics/karach). But it seems like Vecna did not know the Hand had undergone this transformation...
