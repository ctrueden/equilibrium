Zombozo is the ringmaster of the Zombozo circus. He also serves as one of two
clowns during the comedy act, together with the [pixie gang](pixie-gang).

He sustains his unlife by feeding on the laughter of living beings. While he is
capable of draining people's life force, he refrains from doing so in favor of
entertaining crowds at the circus. As such, his unlife literally depends on his
comic delivery: if he's dying on stage, he's *really dying on stage*,
knowwhatI'msaying?
