*not to be confused with:
* [Xaryu of the Perfect Order](xaryu), a crime lord / cult leader from the [Radiant Union of Pelor](../locales/rup)
* [Xaryu](xaryu-hive), overlord [beholder](../creatures/beholders) hive of [Xaryuvia](../locales/xaryuvia)*

One day, a node of the [Xaryu of Xaryuvia](xaryu-hive) awoke from a nightmare of its own death, transformed into a death tyrant. Afterward, it somehow made its way to the [Sanctum of the Reaped Harvest](../locales/elysium-sanctum)...
