A [hamadryad](creatures/hamadryads), and once one of the 12 [Titans](creatures/titans) from whom the [gods](creatures/eternals) were born.

[Callisto](dossiers/cal) met her when he was a child, but she does not seem to remember him. She claims the dying [Yggdrasil](relics/yggdrasil) has clouded her mind.
