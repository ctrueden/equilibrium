A [hamadryad](../creatures/dryads#hamadryads), and once one of the 12 [titans](../creatures/titans) from whom the [gods](../creatures/eternals) were born. Former consort of [Koios](koios).

[Callisto](cal) met her when he was a child, but she does not seem to remember him. She claims the dying [Yggdrasil](../relics/yggdrasil) has clouded her mind.
