title: Roger the Spectral Butler
---

"Roger" (as he was dubbed by [Vondal](vondal) in want of an actual name) is a denizen of [Evershroud Manor](../locales/evershroud-manor). He seems to have been some kind of servant to the archlich [Timor Invictus](timor-invictus), but the transformation of the manor into some kind of "celestial flux" zone has corrupted him into some kind of long-headed many-faced spirit. He is very depressed, and mostly just stays in his room in the servants' quarters.
