An acolyte of the [Progression of Symmetry](../orgs/progression-of-symmetry)
who manipulated people into jumping from the Zenithal Summit for reasons not
wholly understood. The [SPI](../orgs/spi) now believes that Raâ€™faj used a
magical artifact called the
[Lamp of Seeming](../reliquaries/lamp-of-seeming)&mdash;now in the SPI's
possession&mdash;to somehow manipulate people into jumping from the Summit.
It seems he was a member of some sort of secret cult, but further details are
unclear.
