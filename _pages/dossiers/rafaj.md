An acolyte of the Progression of Symmetry who manipulated people into jumping from the Zenithal Summit for reasons not wholly understood. The SPI now believes that Ra’faj used a magical artifact called the Lamp of Seeming&mdash;now in the SPI’s possession&mdash;to somehow manipulate people into jumping from the Summit. It seems he was a member of some sort of secret cult, but further details are unclear.
