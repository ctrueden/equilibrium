Isis Ra'ksh is a druid believed to have orchestrated the theft of the [Necronomicon](../relics/necronomicon) relic from the residence of [Dominic Tremere](dominic-tremere) (see [Case 02: Exchange and Extortion](../events/case-02)). The SPI believed her to be an ex-druid blighter intent on killing the [World Tree](../relics/yggdrasil) using the Book. However, SPI agents recently encountered her with druidic powers at the World Tree's Fruit of Life, and collaborating with the [Fruit's Guardian](erasmus) to defend it from outside interference, making her current motives decidedly unclear.
