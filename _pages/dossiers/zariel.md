Ruler of the [Trell](../locales/trell) island of [Avernus](../locales/avernus).

A celestial warrior corrupted and bound to hellish servitude, Zariel brings military discipline to her island. Her rigid hierarchy and merciless efficiency have transformed Avernus into Trell's industrial heartland. Though once a being of divine purpose, she now serves Asmodeus's vision without question, driving the endless extraction of obsidian and crystal that powers the entire archipelago.
