Once a noted historian, now apparently an insane animalistic creature and/or demon, who appears to have killed and/or eaten [Alex Orbach](alex-orbach). Seems to be confined to the [crystalline Flux](../locales/flux#crystalline-flux) for the time being...

Case 07:
* Sent the SPI an envelope containing an invitation: “R. Mallory” on the outside. On the inside, blank. With detect magic, writing appears: “You possess an object of sufficient power to be of interest. You are cordially invited to participate in an Auction of Divine Potential at the sanctum of the esteemed T. Invictus, His Dreaded Excellency. Be at the 4th Circle of Estanesse at twilight on Evensday. Rest assured that all manner of precautions are being taken to protect all involved parties. Yours sincerely, P. Stormcloud, MAI, MHA.” MAI=Master of Arcane Invocations, MHA=Master of the Historical Arts.
