Priscilla Stormcloud is a noted historian who organized an "auction of divine
potential" at the manor of her friend and colleague [Timor
Invictus](timor-invictus) ([Case 07: Hazard and
Harbingers](../events/case-07)). Her stated goal was to trade the vial, which
she claimed she could not use herself, for an item of commensurate power,
which she planned to study in an effort to repair the Flux.

Unfortunately, the divine essence exploded, and she has not been seen since.
She might be [a demon](balor) now...
