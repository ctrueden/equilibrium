Head of the Dwarven Scholarly Order of Magic at Kham Kuldohr Academy. Advisor to king Durak. Secretly also the leader of Esprit Repose, a necromancer cabal that promises it's totally using these dark powers for the good of the kingdom, and would never do anything evil.

Promised to act as an informant to the SPI, in exchange for them not revealing the existence of Esprit Repose.
