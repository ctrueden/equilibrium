Youngest nephew of Gurin Aldrimor. A self-proclaimed wordsmith, he illicitly practiced necromancy as a member of Esprit Repose.

He believed that his associate Zanic Corbinic was planning terrorist actions against the crown, and he shared his concerns with Rubinia Elka, the cabal's leader. Zanic was expelled on charges of sedition against the Seven High Clans.

Bronce's brother Hollerd murdered their uncle Gurin using poison, which he made from materials stolen from Bronce. Bronce used a technique of Esprit Repose known as the *crawling claw* to change the time of Gurin's clock to cover up his brother's crime.

Bronce is now being held in the dungeons of the Mountain palace, awaiting trial and execution.
