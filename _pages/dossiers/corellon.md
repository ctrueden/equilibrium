## Precepts

* Cultivate beauty in all that you do, whether youâ€™re casting a spell, composing a saga, strumming a lute, or practicing the arts of war.
* Seek out lost magic items, forgotten rituals, and ancient works of art.
* At every opportunity, thwart those who would pervert or destroy natural beauty.
