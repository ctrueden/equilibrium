title: Kavaki
---

* Kavaki tells them she was not in control of her body. She was a helpless witness to her own actions.
* Kavaki is dying. She implores the party to avenge her. Sabrina is super upset.
* Sabrina transfers the tattoos to the PCs (willing or no). The tattoos are: green ([biofeedback](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/psionic-powers/b/biofeedback), DR 4/- for 7 min.); blue ([defy gravity](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/psionic-powers/d/defy-gravity), 1 hour, self only), yellow ([time hop](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/psionic-powers/t/time-hop/), 5 rounds forward, Will DC 15 negates), orange ([hustle](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/psionic-powers/h/hustle)), red ([hammer](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/psionic-powers/h/hammer), 4 touches at 3d8 each) and violet ([vigor](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/psionic-powers/v/vigor/), 20 temporary HP for 7 min.) and black ([truevenom](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/psionic-powers/t/truevenom/), Fort DC 15). But each tattoo also has a very personal effect based on the individual... see “PC tools and tie-ins” below.
