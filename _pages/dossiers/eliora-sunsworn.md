Eliora is the High Conservator of the Sacred Gardens, where magical plants from around [Aecus](../locales/aecus) are cultivated for healing and ritual purposes. She has a practical approach to faith, believing [Pelor's](pelor) blessings are meant to be used, not just venerated.

In her late 50s, she remains vibrant and strong, with sun-darkened skin, silver-streaked dark hair, and a no-nonsense demeanor. She often mediates between [her husband's](benedor) orthodox views and [her daughter's](mayaheine-sunsworn) reformist tendencies.
