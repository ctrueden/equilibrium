A bard, seen during the events of [Petrification and Putrifaction](../events/case-01) as an officer of the Luminous Defenders. The SPI knows him to secretly be a cambion: i.e., his father is a fiend. His mother is [Contessa Morvain](contessa-morvain), a noblewoman.

He is now a member of the [Aecus Concord](../orgs/ac)'s [Military Aid and Defense](../orgs/mad) (MAD) arm.
