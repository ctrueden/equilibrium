Panthea was an acrobat in the [Zombozo](zombozo) circus. She performed with the
[pixie gang](pixie-gang), making use of her prehensile hair&mdash;which she can
move around in independent bundles&mdash;to perform feats of gymnastics and
agility. She is the twin sister of [Meroe](meroe).

During the events of [Revelry and Revenge](../events/case-08), Panthea
initially sided with her sister in a confrontation with the SPI agents, but was
convinced to help her sister face justice for her crimes. Unfortunately, when
the agents escaped on the Vondalstalk into the [crystal flux](../locales/flux),
she and her sister became infected with some kind of wild magic disease, which
began to erode them from the inside.

Panthea was held captive at [SPI HQ](../locales/spi-hq) for a short time until
[Military Aid and Defense](../orgs/mad) agents showed up to eject them from the
premises, at which point the SPI agents took Panthea and Meroe with them
([Amalgamation and Anathema](../events/case-09)).

When the SPI then decided to assist [Bonny Qin](bonny-qin) with a heist of
the [Cornucopia of Life](../relics/cornucopia), Panthea and Meroe joined
them in the hope of drinking from the water to get cured
([Capers and Calamity](../events/case-10)). While Panthea was ultimately able
to drink from the water, she faced the judgment of [Pelor](pelor), who struck
her dead but declared her body and soul cleansed, and headed to a better place.
