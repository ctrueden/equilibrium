Zanic was a writer who believed that dwarven law is exploitative of the masses in favor of the Seven Clans, and wanted equality for everyone across the [Mountain and the Veldt](../locales/mountain). He was anti-patriarchy, anti-slavery and anti-monarchy. Zanic sought to dissolve the Seven Clans in favor of an all-inclusive democratic assembly, by launching a movement called the Free Dwarven Society.

Zanic was [Rubinia Elka](rubinia-elka)'s second in the secret necromancer cabal Esprit Repose, until she expelled him for seditious activity. Zanic believed his expulsion was orchestrated by [Bronce Aldrimor](bronce-aldrimor) "whispering in Rubinia's ear" and executed his vengeance against Clan Aldrimor accordingly, by zombifying [Gurin](gurin-aldrimor), in order to shame the clan and ruin their reputation.

In the course of the investigation, Zanic's disembodied hand was torn to shreds by wild dogs and set on fire by a wild halfling, at which point he promptly died.
