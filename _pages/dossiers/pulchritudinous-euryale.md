Euryale was a “dealer in information”—i.e., a blackmailer—who posed as an art dealer living near the city of Haven. She desperately wanted to be free from her medusa’s curse. She stole a book of immense evil power, the Necronomicon, from the vault of Dominic Tremere, who had in turn liberated it decades ago from Arallu, the land of the undead. Euryale then traded the book to an ex-druid named Isis Ra’ksh, in exchange for a potion of unknown origins which could cure her condition.

She was caught by the SPI shortly after completing this deal, though Isis got away with the book. In exchange for information, Euryale completed the ritual to restore her humanity, and is now in the custody of the Luminous Defenders awaiting trial.
