Euryale was a "dealer in information"&mdash;i.e., a blackmailer&mdash;who posed
as an art dealer living near the city of [Haven](../locales/haven). She
desperately wanted to be free from her medusa's curse. She stole a book of
immense evil power, the [Necronomicon](../reliquaries/necronomicon), from the
vault of [Dominic Tremere](dominic-tremere), who had in turn liberated it
decades ago from [Arallu](../locales/arallu), the land of the undead. Euryale
then traded the book to an ex-druid named [Isis Ra'ksh](isis-raksh), in
exchange for a potion of unknown origins which could cure her condition.

She was caught by the [SPI](../orgs/spi) shortly after completing this deal,
though Isis got away with the book. In exchange for information, Euryale
completed the ritual to restore her humanity, and is now in the custody of the
Luminous Defenders awaiting trial.
