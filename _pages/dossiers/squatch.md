Squatch is the strong man of the [Zombozo](zombozo) circus. He is also a flesh
golem: a grisly assortment of humanoid body parts stitched and bolted together
into a muscled brute imbued with formidable strength. His brain is capable of
simple reason, though his thoughts are no more sophisticated than those of a
young child. The golem's muscle tissue responds to the power of lightning,
invigorating the creature with vitality and strength. Powerful enchantments
protect the golem's skin, deflecting spells and all but the most potent
weapons.

Squatch lurches with a stiff-jointed gait, as if not in complete control of his
body. His dead flesh isn't an ideal container for an elemental spirit, which
sometimes howls incoherently to vent its outrage. If the spirit were to break
free of its creator's will, the golem would go berserk until calmed, or until
its shell of flesh is destroyed or completely healed.

While investigating the circus during [Revelry and Revenge](../events/case-08),
the [SPI](../orgs/spi) became suspicious of a wound in squatch's belly, which
he complained was bothering him.
