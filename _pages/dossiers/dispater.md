Ruler of the [Trell](../locales/trell) island of [Dis](../locales/dis).

A tyrant of control and paranoia, Dispater rules the second-largest island through absolute surveillance. His technomagic networks see all, record all, and judge all. Every transaction, every conversation, every movement in Dis is logged and analyzed. Through Omni Analytics, he has transformed information itself into the ultimate currency, peddling targeted advertising and surveillance data to the highest bidder.

Paranoid and scheming, Dispater views other archfiends with suspicion and jealousy, particularly those who challenge his dominion. His rivalry with [Baalzebul](baalzebul) and [Mephistopheles](mephistopheles) runs deep, rooted in competing visions of power and control.
