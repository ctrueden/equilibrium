The greater deity and primordial of all dragonkind as well as balance and
peace, creating all dragons in its image and is responsible for the destiny of
each and every dragon in the multiverse. According to legends, Io is said to
have created the multiverse itself, holds the memory of everything in
existence, knows all spells, carries one version of every magic item in
existence, and perceives the future.

Creator of the dragon deities [Tiamat](tiamat), [Bahamut](bahamut),
[Sardior](sardior), Semuanya (lizardfolk), and Kurtulmak (kobold).

No deity declares anything but veneration for Io. although followers of
[Gruumsh](gruumsh) sometimes express the belief that Io's embodiment of peace
does not stand in opposition to war&mdash;merely that there is a balance to all
things, including war and peace.
