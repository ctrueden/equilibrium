Daughter of [Saint Benedor the Luminary](benedor). Secretly a [changeling](../creatures/changelings), imprinted on [Enneiah Trueborn](enneiah-trueborn).

In her early 20s, Mayaheine contrasts with her father in appearance and temperament. Where he is measured, she is passionate. She has light brown skin with gold-flecked freckles, amber eyes, and dark brown hair often worn in an updo to keep it out of her way.
