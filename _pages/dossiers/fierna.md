Ruler of the [Trell](../locales/trell) island of [Phlegethos](../locales/phlegethos), serving alongside [Belial](./belial).

Daughter of Belial and a cunning operator in her own right, Fierna rules the island of pleasure and legal warfare. Through Blissco, she provides the entertainment and experiences that fuel Trell's elite, while carefully navigating the treacherous politics of her father's court.

Though bound to [Belial](./belial) by blood and rule, her relationship with him is complicated—they are allied in common purpose but distinct in ambition. Fierna has forged her own alliance with [Glasya](./glasya), who she idolizes as a powerful female presence in the largely male-dominated hierarchy of Trell corporate rule. Together, they challenge the traditional order imposed by rivals like [Dispater](./dispater) and [Mephistopheles](./mephistopheles).
