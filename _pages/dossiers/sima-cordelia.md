A dwarven ranger with an affinity for animals, who “is the muscle” and believes her gifts should be shared with the world. Martine Andrews (see “Rogue actors” below), Dominic Tremere’s former robot butler, called her the “Bringer of War” and implored her to join a quest to hunt down Isis Ra’ksh, an ex-druid believed to possess the Necronomicon, an exceedingly dangerous magical artifact. Sima’s dogs are:
* Attila the Honey (F) - the Alpha Dog
* Gummi Bear Pumpkinpants (M) - the Fighter
* James Franco (M) - the Lonely Dog
