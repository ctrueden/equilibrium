A well-off gnome who is "not the muscle," specializes in ancient and mystical objects, and is "sometimes clairvoyant."

## Rules

Callie is a devotee of the [dual goddesses](../rules/dual-goddess) Erathis and Avandra.

***Inspired reading (Insight).*** You have a supernatural flash of inspiration which yields a line of questioning that, together with a subject's body language and response tone, is likely to extract a secret from them.
