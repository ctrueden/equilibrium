During the events of [Amalgamation and Anathema](../events/case-09), an insane
animalistic creature and/or demon, who appears to have killed and/or eaten
[Alex Orbach](alex-orbach). wearing the tattered clothes of [Priscilla
Stormcloud](priscilla-stormcloud), but halfing-sized and with a ruined
cornucopia tabard through the tatters, transformed into a balor demon and tried
to kill the [SPI agents](../orgs/spi)!

It seems to be confined to the
[crystalline Flux](../locales/flux#crystalline-flux), at least for now...
