*not to be confused with [Xaryu of the Perfect Order](xaryu), a crime lord / cult leader from the [Radiant Union of Pelor](../locales/rup), or [Xaryu the Liberator](xaryu-undead), a former hive node become death tyrant.*

Absolute ruler of [Xaryuvia](../locales/xaryuvia), its underground lair near [Sepulchralis](../locales/sepulchralis), which is home to a colony of enslaved [halflings](../creatures/halflings) who worship it as the scion of [Tiamat](../dossiers/tiamat).

Xaryu of Xaryuvia is believed (by [Bilbo](../dossiers/bilbo) to consist of at least six hive nodes, although "it's hard to be sure, since they are never all in the same place at once."
