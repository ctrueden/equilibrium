Mary Reed was an alias of [Bonny Qin](bonny-qin), as part of a ruse to gain the trust of the [SPI](../orgs/spi) to acquire their help in pulling off [the heist](../events/case-10) of the [Cornucopia of Life](../reliquaries/cornucopia). She appeared as a young [tiefling](../races/tieflings) in simple garb who fought with a quarterstaff, but the SPI discovered her duplicity when they caught her trying to break into the SPI evidence locker.
