title: Mary Reed

Mary Reed was an alias of [Anne Bonny](anne-bonny-qin), as part of a ruse to gain the trust of the SPI to acquire their help in pulling off the heist of the [Cornucopia of Life](../reliquaries/cornucopia). She appeared as a young tiefling in simple garb who fought with a quarterstaff, but the SPI discovered her duplicity when they caught her trying to break into the SPI evidence locker.
