Ruler of the [Trell](../locales/trell) island of [Maladomini](../locales/maladomini).

A master of byzantine bureaucracy and endless schemes, Baalzebul controls the archives and records of all Trell through the labyrinthine infrastructure of [Maladomini](../locales/maladomini). His seat of power is Grenpoli, the City of Diplomacy, where the Trell Political School trains the next generation of lawyers and arbitrators.

Through Perdition Mitigation, Baalzebul operates a vast insurance conglomerate, profiting from the endless contracts, NDAs, and arbitration disputes that plague Trell's corporate landscape. Every contract dispute, every legal conflict, every negotiation that requires neutral arbitration ends up in his domain, making him extraordinarily wealthy despite his relatively peripheral position in the Trell hierarchy of power and control.

Baalzebul views younger power-players like [Glasya](./glasya) with disdain, sees himself as a rival of both [Dispater](./dispater) and [Mephistopheles](./mephistopheles). None truly trust him, but all must negotiate with him eventually.
