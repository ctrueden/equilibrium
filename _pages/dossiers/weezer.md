Weezer is the monster tamer and trainer for the [Zombozo](zombozo) circus.
He utilizes his innate kenku ability to mimic any sound to train the monsters more effectively.

Like many kenku, he loves shiny things, especially his glittery *hat of disguise*.
He dislikes the [pixie gang](pixie-gang) because they tend to prank him by
stealing his shinies.

The show features several monsters that Weezer has trained, including bulettes
Fair & Foul, manticore Sting, otyugh Glump, and owlbears Fuzzy & Wuzzy.
