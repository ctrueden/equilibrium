Weezer is the monster tamer and trainer for the [Zombozo](zombozo) circus.
He utilizes his innate [kenku](../creatures/kenku) ability to mimic any sound to train the monsters more effectively.

Like many kenku, he loves shiny things, especially his glittery *hat of disguise*.
He dislikes the [pixie gang](pixie-gang) because they tend to prank him by
stealing his shinies.

The show features several monsters that Weezer has trained, including [bulettes](../creatures/beasts#bulettes) Fair & Foul, [manticore](../creatures/beasts#manticores) Sting, [otyugh](../creatures/beasts#otyughs) Glump, and [owlbears](../creatures/beasts#owlbears) Fuzzy & Wuzzy.
