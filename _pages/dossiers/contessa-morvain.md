Morvain is a noblewoman in the city of Haven, blackmailed into inadvertently killing Dominic Tremere, a rich dealer of antiquities.

She has a secret: her son Donovan is half fiend (the public explanation for his unusual appearance is that he is half red dragon). The Contessa claims to have done everything in her power to blunt the influence of her sonâ€™s fiendish blood, including many charm spells cast on him throughout his life, as well as illusion magic to conceal his fiendish appearance.

In exchange for keeping her secret, the Contessa has agreed to be an informant and resource for the SPI.
