Ancient creatures from before the world was formed. They hate all of reality, especially the gods, wizards, and magic. Three of them infiltrated the Rockwell family, lured Linistreya Rockwell to them, sent a large military force of sahuagin to attack Cognitutus, and enticed the SPI agents to bring two Reliquaries—the Lamp of Seeming, and the Cornucopia in Hornblade form—to their lair. The SPI defeated them, destroyed their lair, and rescued Lini.
