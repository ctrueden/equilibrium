Ruler of the [Trell](../locales/trell) island of [Stygia](../locales/stygia).

Bound in ice as eternal punishment for his rebellion, Levistus rules his frozen island from isolation. Through Terminus Transport, he controls the shipping and logistics networks that connect all of Trell to the wider world—an ironic dominion for a being trapped in place. The soul larvae stockpile he has accumulated over centuries serves as both insurance and leverage in a precarious political position.

Levistus's relationship with [Glasya](./glasya) is fraught with history and enmity. Whatever transpired between them runs deep enough to make her consider him a bitter enemy despite the necessary commerce between their islands. Isolated and suspicious, Levistus has few true allies, relying instead on the leverage of his control over Trell's vital shipping lanes.
