The pixie gang are a group of ten pixies who work as a team in the [Zombozo](zombozo) circus.

Their leader, Pizzazz, is non-binary. The women include Laramy, Kenta, Sprish, Pahla and Tressie. The men include Woz (scout), Greco, Darro and Zop.

They take the shape of another clown for the comedy act with Zombozo, and do their flying light show during the trapeze act with [Panthea](panthea).

They enjoy pranking [Weezer](weezer) by stealing his shiny things, because it always gets a big rise out of him.
