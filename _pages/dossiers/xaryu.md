*not to be confused with the [Xaryu hive](xaryu-hive) near [Sepulchralis](../locales/sepulchralis), or that hive's [death tyrant former node](xaryu-undead).*

Domineering and xenophobic head of the Xaryu Syndicate&mdash;or "Perfect Order" as they call themselves.

Authorities believe its lair to be somewhere beneath city streets&mdash;but have not pinpointed which city, since the Syndicate has a presence within several of them.
