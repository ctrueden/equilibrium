A disgraced magical-scholar-turned-criminal who developed forbidden Flux-based magic. Used his *flux entanglement* spell to link pieces of chalk, so that he could draw teleportation circles remotely to steal valuable objects, including the Rockwell familyâ€™s Puzzlebox, believed to be one of eight reliquaries somehow central to the integrity of reality itself. Also developed *flux disjunction* beads for use in a pinch, and crafted a *dimensional knife* using similar techniques. Believed to have killed Dominic Tremere in self defense, then attempted to frame Bram the Blithe. Later found dead within a bizarre crystalline Flux realm paralleling normal reality. Neither the Puzzlebox nor his spellbook have been recovered.
