First mate of the [Tempest pirate ship](../relics/tempest) under [Bram the Blithe](bram-the-blithe). Impersonated her sister, [Seirye Qin](seirye-qin), and before that pretended to be an SPI recruit named [Mary Reed](mary-reed). Together with SPI agents, facilitated a "heist" of the [Cornucopia](../relics/cornucopia), to protect it from a vaguely defined future "calamity" prophesied by [Melora](melora), goddess of storms and the sea.
