A veteran [wild mage who's been working with the [SPI](../orgs/spi) for decades,
but seems to be afflicted by some sort of malignant chronomancy.

### Tapestry of Fate

***Lucid memory (Luck).*** You remember something from the past which is relevant.

### Class Archetype

* [Wild Magic](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/sorcerer:wild-magic)

### Magic items

Wand of Wonder
* Thanks to his experience with wild magic, Vondal has learned to control the
  behavior of his Wand of Wonder. When manifesting an effect from the wand, he
  can spend sorcery points to affect the outcome. After rolling the d100, he
  may add or subtract to the result by up to 7 per sorcery point spent.
  (OR: subtract only? OR: spend sorcery points to roll multiple times?)
* In addition, while holding the wand, Vondal gains a +2 bonus to spell attack
  rolls, and ignores half cover when making a spell attack, with wild magic.

Wand of Healing
* 7 charges
* regain 1d4 charges every dawn
* 1 charge = Cure Wounds level 1
