A once-undead servant of [Timor Invictus](../dossiers/timor-invictus) who kept his [household](../locales/evershroud-manor) in order. The cleansing of the [Necronomicon](../relics/necronomicon) has corrupted him into some kind of long-headed many-faced spirit, likely [Flux](../locales/flux)-tainted. He seems very depressed about it, mostly staying in his room in the servants' quarters.
