Elder of the [Stormherd](../orgs/stormherd) tribe of
[yak-folk](../creatures/yikarians), and a powerful diviner. As he approached death,
he concocted a plot to create and steal a weapon made of Karach, the only
substance known to resist the [Flux](../locales/flux). With the help of
spiritual essence from the
slain [Manufeai](../orgs/manufeai) tribe, along with the powers of his earth
genie [Zanqaa the Devoted](zanqaa-the-devoted), he transformed himself into a
monstrous entity. The [SPI](../orgs/spi) slew him, but the stain of the Flux
persists on the grounds where the events took place.
