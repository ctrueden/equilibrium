Elder of the Stormherd tribe of yak-folk, and a powerful diviner. As he approached death, he concocted a plot to create and steal a weapon made of Karach, the only substance known to resist the Flux. With the help of spiritual essence from the slain Manufeai tribe, along with the powers of his earth genie Zanqaa the Devoted, he transformed himself into a monstrous entity. The SPI slew him, but the stain of the Flux persists on the grounds where the events took place.
