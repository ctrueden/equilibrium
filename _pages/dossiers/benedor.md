A man in his early 60s with dark skin, piercing golden eyes, a shaved head, and well-kept white beard that seems to glow with inner light. Despite his age, he stands straight-backed and moves with purpose.

He is husband to [Eliora Sunsworn](eliora-sunsworn) and father to [Mayaheine Sunsworn](mayaheine-sunsworn).
