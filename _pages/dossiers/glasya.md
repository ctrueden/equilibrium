Ruler of the [Trell](../locales/trell) island of [Malbolge](../locales/malbolge).

A cunning and ruthless operator, Glasya recently seized control of Malbolge by ousting the Hag Countess Malagard. Her grip on the island's criminal underworld is absolute, and through Venom Corp, she controls the supply of dangerous substances and black market goods that flow throughout Trell. The hags of Malbolge grudgingly submit to her will.

Despite her youth compared to other archfiends, Glasya has earned the favor of [Asmodeus](./asmodeus) himself—a recognition of her cunning and potential. This favor, combined with her alliance with [Fierna](./fierna), makes her a rising power.
