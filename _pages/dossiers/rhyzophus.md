A cloud [giant](../creatures/giants) wizard who was once part of [Hyperion](hyperion)'s court. He was exiled from giant society after being even more of an asshole than most giants.

Subsequently, Rhyzophus gathered up similar malcontents&mdash;especially those with magical powers&mdash;and formed a cult called [Ordning's Downfall](../orgs/ordnings-downfall), which plotted a rebellion against the giant ruling class. Fortunately for giantkind's status quo, [the SPI](../orgs/spi) was [there to stop them](../events/case-17).
