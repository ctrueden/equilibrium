A farmer, and eldest nephew of Gurin Aldrimor. Tough but dour, Hollerd is in many ways a stereotypical dwarf. He became a farmer because unlike his siblings, he was no good at smithing, soldiering or magic. He spent much of his life sulking because nobody believed in him, which was largely accurate.

He learned that his uncle was going to confess an old secret which would ruin his family name. To prevent this from happening, he poisoned his uncle using midnight tears - the only poison strong enough to kill a dwarf.

He is now awaiting trial and execution in the dungeons of the Mountain palace.
