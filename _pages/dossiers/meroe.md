Meroe was an alchemist wizard, and pyrotechnician of the [Zombozo](zombozo)
circus. She orchestrated a double homicide and plotted to frame her mentor
Zombozo for the crime, in retribution for his role in the death of her parents
when she and her twin sister [Panthea](panthea) were children. When her plot
was in danger of being sussed out by the SPI, she unsuccessfully tried to
murder the SPI investigators using explosives and the circus monsters.

After being exposed to a pathogen circa the time of travel within the
[crystalline Flux](../locales/flux), Meroe became increasingly ill, eventually
transforming into a shell of her former self. She disintegrated into dust just
before she reached the [Cornucopiaâ€™s of Life](../reliquaries/cornucopia)'s
sacred waters of healing.
