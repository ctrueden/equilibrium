Alchemist wizard and pyrotechnician. Orchestrated a double homicide and plotted to frame her mentor Zombozo for the crime, in retribution for his role in the death of her parents when she and her sister Panthea were children. Unsuccessfully tried to murder the SPI investigators using explosives and the circus monsters. After being exposed to a pathogen circa the time of travel within the crystalline Flux, Meroe became increasingly ill, eventually transforming into a shell of her former self. She disintegrated into dust just before she reached the Cornucopia’s of Life’s sacred waters of healing.
