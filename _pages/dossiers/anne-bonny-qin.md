First mate of the Tempest pirate ship under Bram the Blithe. Impersonated her sister, Seirye Qin, and before that pretended to be an SPI recruit named Mary Reed. Together with SPI agents, facilitated a “heist” of the Cornucopia, to protect it from a vaguely defined future “calamity” prophesied by Melora, goddess of storms and the sea.
