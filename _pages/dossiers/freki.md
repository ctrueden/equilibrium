Freki is a bounty hunter who venerates nature and despises magic. He prowls the [Selva](../locales/selva), seeking prey.

## Rules

### Tapestry of Fate

***Animal instinct (Survival).*** You smell emotions, even as they fade, and can even track people by the "emotional trail" they leave.

### Variant Class: Lycan Ranger

See the [lycan ranger](../rules/lycan-ranger) rules.

#### Special Arrow Types

Freki’s special arrow types so far:
1. Melf’s Acid Arrow
2. Hail of Thorns
3. Ensnaring Strike
4. Spike Growth
5. Lightning Arrow
6. Arrow of Slaying
  * Must be infused with part of the creature to be slain for full effect (6d10)
  * Or infused with part of the same type of creature for half effect (3d10)

#### Other Arrow Types

1. Non-magical grappling arrow
2. Non-magical cotton-tipped arrows

#### Innate Natural Abilities

* \[L2\] [Animal friendship](http://www.5esrd.com/spellcasting/all-spells/a/animal-friendship/). Cast as a ritual – takes 5 minutes to bond with an animal. Animal must be neutral or friendly to initiate.
* \[L2\] [Speak with animals](http://www.5esrd.com/spellcasting/all-spells/s/speak-with-animals/). Requires concentration – uses an action each round of use.
* \[L3\] Swift shot. As a bonus action, draw and fire an arrow at -4 penalty.
* \[L5\] Beast sense. You use your action to transfer your consciousness to Hugin or Munin. You see through its eyes, and hear what it hears for up to 1 hour, while becoming oblivious to your own usual sight and hearing. Another action returns you to your own body.
* \[L7\] [Hunter’s mark](https://www.5esrd.com/spellcasting/all-spells/h/hunter-s-mark/). Once per short rest – but note it can be thrown again if first target dies.
* \[L9\] Amphibious nature. Cursed by aboleths, redeemed by Pelor.
* [L11\] Regeneration. You regain 1d6 hit points every 10 minutes, provided that you have at least 1 hit point. If you lose a body part, the missing part regrows and returns to full functionality after 1d6 + 1 days if you have at least 1 hit point the whole time.
* \[L13\] Speak with plants.
* \[L15\] TBD
* \[L17\] TBD
* \[L19\] TBD
