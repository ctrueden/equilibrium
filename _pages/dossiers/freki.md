#### TODO - 2022-11-19 revision

Use 5e werewolves, but change:
- Stat changes:
  - wolf form stat changes -- +4 str +2 dex +4 con -4 int -4 wis
  - hybrid form -- +2 str +2 con -2 int -2 wis
- At L1 -- one claw and one bite (hybrid or beast)
  - 5th level "Extra attack" in beast form means a second claw

Primeval Awareness -- approx direction as well

Beast Form upgrade choices (L6 and L14)
* scent of blood -- chosen by Freki at L6
* savage critical -- melee attacks score crit on 19 or 20
* thrash -- any successful natural weapon attack also does claw damage vs chosen hostile w/in 5 ft for 1/2 damage
* primal strike -- attacks in wolf or hybrid count as magical +1
* rake -- if both claws hit in full wolf form, can rake with hind legs

scent of blood - once wounded, foe suffers another 1d6 with my following successful attacks. foe cannot disengage, or hide in any way -- including invisibility while -- from me while within melee (or close downwind). but actions not focused on the target are at disadvantage until the target while the target is still present/active.
-- TODO word better
-- see also https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Scent

put innate nat abilities count into lycan ranger table

L7 advantage on initiative
- replace focused shot -- move focused shot to innate abilities options
