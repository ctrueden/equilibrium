Freki is a bounty hunter who venerates nature and despises magic. He prowls the [Selva](../locales/selva), seeking prey.

### Tapestry of Fate

***Animal instinct (Survival).*** You smell emotions, even as they fade, and can even track people by the "emotional trail" they leave.

### Ranger Archetype: Lycan
