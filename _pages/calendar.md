title: Calendar

Before the Flux, every nation had its own languages, and own way of tracking time.
When the Aecus Concord was founded, a common language was established, and a
common calendar was founded which honored all the major religions.

The sun and moon move in tandem, somehow linked. But while the sun rises around
different elemental poles over the course of the year, creating seasons that
differ by region, the moon looks the same to everyone worldwide. And so the
new moon was chosen as the hallmark of a new lunar year.

Is there a sun?
- Yep, one. Solar cycle = lunar cycle = annual cycle.
Is there a moon?
- Yep, one. Lunar cycle = solar cycle = annual cycle.
Is there weather?
- Yes, there are seasons. Caused by the sun's rotation around the elemental poles.
- The sun rise counterclockwise of the current elemental tide.
- The sun would set clockwise of the current elemental tide.

Ley lines pulsing with elemental power?

### Ignan

Before the Flux, the Radiant Union of Pelor and the dwarves of the Mountain
shared a calendar aligned to their weather.

The Ignan year consists of 368 days, split into twelve months of twenty-eight
days each, and four eight-day festivals, each placed at three-month intervals.
The months and festivals are commonly referred to as the Dozenmonth of Luna
and the Four Festivals.

## Elyria

Notice that the elves don't celebrate extremes, like when solstices occur, but
rather seasonal midpoints, illustrative of their philosophy of balance.

Years are counted from the last planting of the World Tree. Cycles are counted.
E.g. Year 985, Cycle 37.

30 * 12 = 360 days
+8 days, corresponding to moon peaks and midpoints
weeks are 10 days
no names for each day
21 Hammer = 1st day of 3rd tenday
